      <p>MALINGERERS</p>

      <p>
        MARFA PETROVNA PETCHONKIN, the General&rsquo;s widow, who has been
        practising for ten years as a homeopathic doctor, is seeing patients in
        her study on one of the Tuesdays in May. On the table before her lie a
        chest of homeopathic drugs, a book on homeopathy, and bills from a
        homeopathic chemist. On the wall the letters from some Petersburg
        homeopath, in Marfa Petrovna&rsquo;s opinion a very celebrated and great
        man, hang under glass in a gilt frame, and there also is a portrait of
        Father Aristark, to whom the lady owes her salvation &mdash;that is, the
        renunciation of pernicious allopathy and the knowledge of the truth. In
        the vestibule patients are sitting waiting, for the most part peasants.
        All but two or three of them are barefoot, as the lady has given orders
        that their ill- smelling boots are to be left in the yard.
      </p>

      <p>
        Marfa Petrovna has already seen ten patients when she calls the
        eleventh: &ldquo;Gavrila Gruzd!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The door opens and instead of Gavrila Gruzd, Zamuhrishen, a neighbouring
        landowner who has sunk into poverty, a little old man with sour eyes,
        and with a gentleman&rsquo;s cap under his arm, walks into the room. He
        puts down his stick in the corner, goes up to the lady, and without a
        word drops on one knee before her.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What are you about, Kuzma Kuzmitch?&rdquo; cries the lady in
        horror, flushing crimson. &ldquo;For goodness sake!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;While I live I will not rise,&rdquo; says Zamuhrishen, bending
        over her hand. &ldquo;Let all the world see my homage on my knees, our
        guardian angel, benefactress of the human race! Let them! Before the
        good fairy who has given me life, guided me into the path of truth, and
        enlightened my scepticism I am ready not merely to kneel but to pass
        through fire, our miraculous healer, mother of the orphan and the
        widowed! I have recovered. I am a new man, enchantress!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I . . . I am very glad . . .&rdquo; mutters the lady, flushing
        with pleasure. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so pleasant to hear that. . . Sit down
        please! Why, you were so seriously ill that Tuesday.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes indeed, how ill I was! It&rsquo;s awful to recall it,&rdquo;
        says Zamuhrishen, taking a seat. &ldquo;I had rheumatism in every part
        and every organ. I have been in misery for eight years, I&rsquo;ve had
        no rest from it . . . by day or by night, my benefactress. I have
        consulted doctors, and I went to professors at Kazan; I have tried all
        sorts of mud-baths, and drunk waters, and goodness knows what I
        haven&rsquo;t tried! I have wasted all my substance on doctors, my
        beautiful lady. The doctors did me nothing but harm. They drove the
        disease inwards. Drive in, that they did, but to drive out was beyond
        their science. All they care about is their fees, the brigands; but as
        for the benefit of humanity&mdash;for that they don&rsquo;t care a
        straw. They prescribe some quackery, and you have to drink it.
        Assassins, that&rsquo;s the only word for them. If it hadn&rsquo;t been
        for you, our angel, I should have been in the grave by now! I went home
        from you that Tuesday, looked at the pilules that you gave me then, and
        wondered what good there could be in them. Was it possible that those
        little grains, scarcely visible, could cure my immense, long-standing
        disease? That&rsquo;s what I thought&mdash;unbeliever that I
        was!&mdash;and I smiled; but when I took the pilule&mdash;it was
        instantaneous! It was as though I had not been ill, or as though it had
        been lifted off me. My wife looked at me with her eyes starting out of
        her head and couldn&rsquo;t believe it. &lsquo;Why, is it you,
        Kolya?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, it is I,&rsquo; I said. And we knelt down
        together before the ikon, and fell to praying for our angel: &lsquo;Send
        her, O Lord, all that we are feeling!&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Zamuhrishen wipes his eyes with his sleeve gets up from his chair, and
        shows a disposition to drop on one knee again; but the lady checks him
        and makes him sit down.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not me you must thank,&rdquo; she says, blushing with
        excitement and looking enthusiastically at the portrait of Father
        Aristark. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my doing. . . . I am only the obedient
        instrument . . It&rsquo;s really a miracle. Rheumatism of eight
        years&rsquo; standing by one pilule of scrofuloso!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, you were so kind as to give me three pilules. One I
        took at dinner and the effect was instantaneous! Another in the evening,
        and the third next day; and since then not a touch! Not a twinge
        anywhere! And you know I thought I was dying, I had written to Moscow
        for my son to come! The Lord has given you wisdom, our lady of healing!
        Now I am walking, and feel as though I were in Paradise. The Tuesday I
        came to you I was hobbling, and now I am ready to run after a hare. . .
        . I could live for a hundred years. There&rsquo;s only one trouble, our
        lack of means. I&rsquo;m well now, but what&rsquo;s the use of health if
        there&rsquo;s nothing to live on? Poverty weighs on me worse than
        illness. . . . For example, take this . . . It&rsquo;s the time to sow
        oats, and how is one to sow it if one has no seed? I ought to buy it,
        but the money . . . everyone knows how we are off for money. . .
        .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I will give you oats, Kuzma Kuzmitch. . . . Sit down, sit down.
        You have so delighted me, you have given me so much pleasure that
        it&rsquo;s not you but I that should say thank you!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are our joy! That the Lord should create such goodness!
        Rejoice, Madam, looking at your good deeds! . . . While we sinners have
        no cause for rejoicing in ourselves. . . . We are paltry, poor-spirited,
        useless people . . . a mean lot. . . . We are only gentry in name, but
        in a material sense we are the same as peasants, only worse. . . . We
        live in stone houses, but it&rsquo;s a mere make-believe . . . for the
        roof leaks. And there is no money to buy wood to mend it with.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the wood, Kuzma Kuzmitch.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        Zamuhrishen asks for and gets a cow too, a letter of recommendation for
        his daughter whom he wants to send to a boarding school, and . . .
        touched by the lady&rsquo;s liberality he whimpers with excess of
        feeling, twists his mouth, and feels in his pocket for his handkerchief
        . . . .
      </p>

      <p>
        Marfa Petrovna sees a red paper slip out of his pocket with his
        handkerchief and fall noiselessly to the floor.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall never forget it to all eternity . . .&rdquo; he mutters,
        &ldquo;and I shall make my children and my grandchildren remember it . .
        . from generation to generation. &lsquo;See, children,&rsquo; I shall
        say, &lsquo;who has saved me from the grave, who . . .&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        When she has seen her patient out, the lady looks for a minute at Father
        Aristark with eyes full of tears, then turns her caressing, reverent
        gaze on the drug chest, the books, the bills, the armchair in which the
        man she had saved from death has just been sitting, and her eyes fall on
        the paper just dropped by her patient. She picks up the paper, unfolds
        it, and sees in it three pilules&mdash;the very pilules she had given
        Zamuhrishen the previous Tuesday.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They are the very ones,&rdquo; she thinks puzzled. &ldquo;. . .
        The paper is the same. . . . He hasn&rsquo;t even unwrapped them! What
        has he taken then? Strange. . . . Surely he wouldn&rsquo;t try to
        deceive me!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And for the first time in her ten years of practice a doubt creeps into
        Marfa Petrovna&rsquo;s mind. . . . She summons the other patients, and
        while talking to them of their complaints notices what has hitherto
        slipped by her ears unnoticed. The patients, every one of them as though
        they were in a conspiracy, first belaud her for their miraculous cure,
        go into raptures over her medical skill, and abuse allopath doctors,
        then when she is flushed with excitement, begin holding forth on their
        needs. One asks for a bit of land to plough, another for wood, a third
        for permission to shoot in her forests, and so on. She looks at the
        broad, benevolent countenance of Father Aristark who has revealed the
        truth to her, and a new truth begins gnawing at her heart. An evil
        oppressive truth. . . .
      </p>
