      <h1>A DEAD BODY</h1>

      <p>
        A STILL August night. A mist is rising slowly from the fields and
        casting an opaque veil over everything within eyesight. Lighted up by
        the moon, the mist gives the impression at one moment of a calm,
        boundless sea, at the next of an immense white wall. The air is damp and
        chilly. Morning is still far off. A step from the bye-road which runs
        along the edge of the forest a little fire is gleaming. A dead body,
        covered from head to foot with new white linen, is lying under a young
        oak-tree. A wooden ikon is lying on its breast. Beside the corpse almost
        on the road sits the &ldquo;watch&rdquo;&mdash;two peasants performing
        one of the most disagreeable and uninviting of peasants&rsquo; duties.
        One, a tall young fellow with a scarcely perceptible moustache and thick
        black eyebrows, in a tattered sheepskin and bark shoes, is sitting on
        the wet grass, his feet stuck out straight in front of him, and is
        trying to while away the time with work. He bends his long neck, and
        breathing loudly through his nose, makes a spoon out of a big crooked
        bit of wood; the other&mdash;a little scraggy, pock-marked peasant with
        an aged face, a scanty moustache, and a little goat&rsquo;s
        beard&mdash;sits with his hands dangling loose on his knees, and without
        moving gazes listlessly at the light. A small camp-fire is lazily
        burning down between them, throwing a red glow on their faces. There is
        perfect stillness. The only sounds are the scrape of the knife on the
        wood and the crackling of damp sticks in the fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go to sleep, Syoma . . .&rdquo; says the young
        man.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I . . . I am not asleep . . .&rdquo; stammers the goat-beard.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. . . . It would be dreadful to sit here
        alone, one would be frightened. You might tell me something,
        Syoma.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are a queer fellow, Syomushka! Other people will laugh and
        tell a story and sing a song, but you&mdash;there is no making you out.
        You sit like a scarecrow in the garden and roll your eyes at the fire.
        You can&rsquo;t say anything properly . . . when you speak you seem
        frightened. I dare say you are fifty, but you have less sense than a
        child. Aren&rsquo;t you sorry that you are a simpleton?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; the goat-beard answers gloomily.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And we are sorry to see your foolishness, you may be sure. You
        are a good-natured, sober peasant, and the only trouble is that you have
        no sense in your head. You should have picked up some sense for yourself
        if the Lord has afflicted you and given you no understanding. You must
        make an effort, Syoma. . . . You should listen hard when anything
        good&rsquo;s being said, note it well, and keep thinking and thinking. .
        . . If there is any word you don&rsquo;t understand, you should make an
        effort and think over in your head in what meaning the word is used. Do
        you see? Make an effort! If you don&rsquo;t gain some sense for yourself
        you&rsquo;ll be a simpleton and of no account at all to your dying
        day.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        All at once a long drawn-out, moaning sound is heard in the forest.
        Something rustles in the leaves as though torn from the very top of the
        tree and falls to the ground. All this is faintly repeated by the echo.
        The young man shudders and looks enquiringly at his companion.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an owl at the little birds,&rdquo; says Syoma,
        gloomily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, Syoma, it&rsquo;s time for the birds to fly to the warm
        countries!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;To be sure, it is time.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It is chilly at dawn now. It is co-old. The crane is a chilly
        creature, it is tender. Such cold is death to it. I am not a crane, but
        I am frozen. . . . Put some more wood on!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Syoma gets up and disappears in the dark undergrowth. While he is busy
        among the bushes, breaking dry twigs, his companion puts his hand over
        his eyes and starts at every sound. Syoma brings an armful of wood and
        lays it on the fire. The flame irresolutely licks the black twigs with
        its little tongues, then suddenly, as though at the word of command,
        catches them and throws a crimson light on the faces, the road, the
        white linen with its prominences where the hands and feet of the corpse
        raise it, the ikon. The &ldquo;watch&rdquo; is silent. The young man
        bends his neck still lower and sets to work with still more nervous
        haste. The goat- beard sits motionless as before and keeps his eyes
        fixed on the fire. . . .
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ye that love not Zion . . . shall be put to shame by the
        Lord.&rdquo; A falsetto voice is suddenly heard singing in the stillness
        of the night, then slow footsteps are audible, and the dark figure of a
        man in a short monkish cassock and a broad-brimmed hat, with a wallet on
        his shoulders, comes into sight on the road in the crimson firelight.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thy will be done, O Lord! Holy Mother!&rdquo; the figure says in
        a husky falsetto. &ldquo;I saw the fire in the outer darkness and my
        soul leapt for joy. . . . At first I thought it was men grazing a drove
        of horses, then I thought it can&rsquo;t be that, since no horses were
        to be seen. &lsquo;Aren&rsquo;t they thieves,&rsquo; I wondered,
        &lsquo;aren&rsquo;t they robbers lying in wait for a rich Lazarus?
        Aren&rsquo;t they the gypsy people offering sacrifices to idols? And my
        soul leapt for joy. &lsquo;Go, Feodosy, servant of God,&rsquo; I said to
        myself, &lsquo;and win a martyr&rsquo;s crown!&rsquo; And I flew to the
        fire like a light-winged moth. Now I stand before you, and from your
        outer aspect I judge of your souls: you are not thieves and you are not
        heathens. Peace be to you!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Good-evening.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Good orthodox people, do you know how to reach the Makuhinsky
        Brickyards from here?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s close here. You go straight along the road; when you
        have gone a mile and a half there will be Ananova, our village. From the
        village, father, you turn to the right by the river-bank, and so you
        will get to the brickyards. It&rsquo;s two miles from Ananova.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;God give you health. And why are you sitting here?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We are sitting here watching. You see, there is a dead body. . .
        .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What? what body? Holy Mother!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        The pilgrim sees the white linen with the ikon on it, and starts so
        violently that his legs give a little skip. This unexpected sight has an
        overpowering effect upon him. He huddles together and stands as though
        rooted to the spot, with wide-open mouth and staring eyes. For three
        minutes he is silent as though he could not believe his eyes, then
        begins muttering:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;O Lord! Holy Mother! I was going along not meddling with anyone,
        and all at once such an affliction.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What may you be?&rdquo; enquires the young man. &ldquo;Of the
        clergy?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No . . . no. . . . I go from one monastery to another. . . . Do
        you know Mi . . . Mihail Polikarpitch, the foreman of the brickyard?
        Well, I am his nephew. . . . Thy will be done, O Lord! Why are you
        here?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;We are watching . . . we are told to.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes . . .&rdquo; mutters the man in the cassock, passing his
        hand over his eyes. &ldquo;And where did the deceased come from?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He was a stranger.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Such is life! But I&rsquo;ll . . . er . . . be getting on,
        brothers. . . . I feel flustered. I am more afraid of the dead than of
        anything, my dear souls! And only fancy! while this man was alive he
        wasn&rsquo;t noticed, while now when he is dead and given over to
        corruption we tremble before him as before some famous general or a
        bishop. . . . Such is life; was he murdered, or what?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The Lord knows! Maybe he was murdered, or maybe he died of
        himself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes. . . . Who knows, brothers? Maybe his soul is now
        tasting the joys of Paradise.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;His soul is still hovering here, near his body,&rdquo; says the
        young man. &ldquo;It does not depart from the body for three
        days.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;H&rsquo;m, yes! . . . How chilly the nights are now! It sets
        one&rsquo;s teeth chattering. . . . So then I am to go straight on and
        on? . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Till you get to the village, and then you turn to the right by
        the river-bank.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;By the river-bank. . . . To be sure. . . . Why am I standing
        still? I must go on. Farewell, brothers.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>The man in the cassock takes five steps along the road and stops.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten to put a kopeck for the burying,&rdquo; he
        says. &ldquo;Good orthodox friends, can I give the money?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You ought to know best, you go the round of the monasteries. If
        he died a natural death it would go for the good of his soul; if
        it&rsquo;s a suicide it&rsquo;s a sin.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true. . . . And maybe it really was a suicide! So I
        had better keep my money. Oh, sins, sins! Give me a thousand roubles and
        I would not consent to sit here. . . . Farewell, brothers.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>The cassock slowly moves away and stops again.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make up my mind what I am to do,&rdquo; he mutters.
        &ldquo;To stay here by the fire and wait till daybreak. . . . I am
        frightened; to go on is dreadful, too. The dead man will haunt me all
        the way in the darkness. . . . The Lord has chastised me indeed! Over
        three hundred miles I have come on foot and nothing happened, and now I
        am near home and there&rsquo;s trouble. I can&rsquo;t go on. . .
        .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It is dreadful, that is true.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am not afraid of wolves, of thieves, or of darkness, but I am
        afraid of the dead. I am afraid of them, and that is all about it. Good
        orthodox brothers, I entreat you on my knees, see me to the
        village.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been told not to go away from the body.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No one will see, brothers. Upon my soul, no one will see! The
        Lord will reward you a hundredfold! Old man, come with me, I beg! Old
        man! Why are you silent?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;He is a bit simple,&rdquo; says the young man.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You come with me, friend; I will give you five kopecks.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For five kopecks I might,&rdquo; says the young man, scratching
        his head, &ldquo;but I was told not to. If Syoma here, our simpleton,
        will stay alone, I will take you. Syoma, will you stay here
        alone?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay,&rdquo; the simpleton consents.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right, then. Come along!&rdquo; The young
        man gets up, and goes with the cassock. A minute later the sound of
        their steps and their talk dies away. Syoma shuts his eyes and gently
        dozes. The fire begins to grow dim, and a big black shadow falls on the
        dead body.
