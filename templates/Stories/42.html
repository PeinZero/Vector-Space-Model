      <p>A TRIPPING TONGUE</p>

      <p>
        NATALYA MIHALOVNA, a young married lady who had arrived in the morning
        from Yalta, was having her dinner, and in a never-ceasing flow of babble
        was telling her husband of all the charms of the Crimea. Her husband,
        delighted, gazed tenderly at her enthusiastic face, listened, and from
        time to time put in a question.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But they say living is dreadfully expensive there?&rdquo; he
        asked, among other things.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what shall I say? To my thinking this talk of its being so
        expensive is exaggerated, hubby. The devil is not as black as he is
        painted. Yulia Petrovna and I, for instance, had very decent and
        comfortable rooms for twenty roubles a day. Everything depends on
        knowing how to do things, my dear. Of course if you want to go up into
        the mountains . . . to Aie-Petri for instance . . . if you take a horse,
        a guide, then of course it does come to something. It&rsquo;s awful what
        it comes to! But, Vassitchka, the mountains there! Imagine high, high
        mountains, a thousand times higher than the church. . . . At the
        top&mdash;mist, mist, mist. . . . At the bottom &mdash;enormous stones,
        stones, stones. . . . And pines. . . . Ah, I can&rsquo;t bear to think
        of it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;By the way, I read about those Tatar guides there, in some
        magazine while you were away . . . . such abominable stories! Tell me is
        there really anything out of the way about them?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Natalya Mihalovna made a little disdainful grimace and shook her head.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Just ordinary Tatars, nothing special . . .&rdquo; she said,
        &ldquo;though indeed I only had a glimpse of them in the distance. They
        were pointed out to me, but I did not take much notice of them. You
        know, hubby, I always had a prejudice against all such Circassians,
        Greeks . . . Moors!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;They are said to be terrible Don Juans.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Perhaps! There are shameless creatures who . . . .&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        Natalya Mihalovna suddenly jumped up from her chair, as though she had
        thought of something dreadful; for half a minute she looked with
        frightened eyes at her husband and said, accentuating each word:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Vassitchka, I say, the im-mo-ral women there are in the world!
        Ah, how immoral! And it&rsquo;s not as though they were working-class or
        middle-class people, but aristocratic ladies, priding themselves on
        their bon-ton! It was simply awful, I could not believe my own eyes! I
        shall remember it as long as I live! To think that people can forget
        themselves to such a point as . . . ach, Vassitchka, I don&rsquo;t like
        to speak of it! Take my companion, Yulia Petrovna, for example. . . .
        Such a good husband, two children . . . she moves in a decent circle,
        always poses as a saint&mdash;and all at once, would you believe it. . .
        . Only, hubby, of course this is entre nous. . . . Give me your word of
        honour you won&rsquo;t tell a soul?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What next! Of course I won&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Honour bright? Mind now! I trust you. . . .&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        The little lady put down her fork, assumed a mysterious air, and
        whispered:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Imagine a thing like this. . . . That Yulia Petrovna rode up into
        the mountains . . . . It was glorious weather! She rode on ahead with
        her guide, I was a little behind. We had ridden two or three miles, all
        at once, only fancy, Vassitchka, Yulia cried out and clutched at her
        bosom. Her Tatar put his arm round her waist or she would have fallen
        off the saddle. . . . I rode up to her with my guide. . . . &lsquo;What
        is it? What is the matter?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;I
        am dying! I feel faint! I can&rsquo;t go any further&rsquo; Fancy my
        alarm! &lsquo;Let us go back then,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;No,
        Natalie,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t go back! I shall die of
        pain if I move another step! I have spasms.&rsquo; And she prayed and
        besought my Suleiman and me to ride back to the town and fetch her some
        of her drops which always do her good.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Stay. . . . I don&rsquo;t quite understand you,&rdquo; muttered
        the husband, scratching his forehead. &ldquo;You said just now that you
        had only seen those Tatars from a distance, and now you are talking of
        some Suleiman.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There, you are finding fault again,&rdquo; the lady pouted, not
        in the least disconcerted. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t endure suspiciousness! I
        can&rsquo;t endure it! It&rsquo;s stupid, stupid!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am not finding fault, but . . . why say what is not true? If
        you rode about with Tatars, so be it, God bless you, but . . . why
        shuffle about it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;H&rsquo;m! . . . you are a queer one!&rdquo; cried the lady,
        revolted. &ldquo;He is jealous of Suleiman! as though one could ride up
        into the mountains without a guide! I should like to see you do it! If
        you don&rsquo;t know the ways there, if you don&rsquo;t understand, you
        had better hold your tongue! Yes, hold your tongue. You can&rsquo;t take
        a step there without a guide.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;So it seems!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;None of your silly grins, if you please! I am not a Yulia. . . .
        I don&rsquo;t justify her but I . . . ! Though I don&rsquo;t pose as a
        saint, I don&rsquo;t forget myself to that degree. My Suleiman never
        overstepped the limits. . . . No-o! Mametkul used to be sitting at
        Yulia&rsquo;s all day long, but in my room as soon as it struck eleven:
        &lsquo;Suleiman, march! Off you go!&rsquo; And my foolish Tatar boy
        would depart. I made him mind his p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s, hubby! As
        soon as he began grumbling about money or anything, I would say
        &lsquo;How? Wha-at? Wha-a-a-t?&rsquo; And his heart would be in his
        mouth directly. . . . Ha-ha-ha! His eyes, you know, Vassitchka, were as
        black, as black, like coals, such an amusing little Tatar face, so funny
        and silly! I kept him in order, didn&rsquo;t I just!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can fancy . . .&rdquo; mumbled her husband, rolling up pellets
        of bread.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s stupid, Vassitchka! I know what is in your mind! I
        know what you are thinking . . . But I assure you even when we were on
        our expeditions I never let him overstep the limits. For instance, if we
        rode to the mountains or to the U-Chan-Su waterfall, I would always say
        to him, &lsquo;Suleiman, ride behind! Do you hear!&rsquo; And he always
        rode behind, poor boy. . . . Even when we . . . even at the most
        dramatic moments I would say to him, &lsquo;Still, you must not forget
        that you are only a Tatar and I am the wife of a civil
        councillor!&rsquo; Ha-ha. . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The little lady laughed, then, looking round her quickly and assuming an
        alarmed expression, whispered:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But Yulia! Oh, that Yulia! I quite see, Vassitchka, there is no
        reason why one shouldn&rsquo;t have a little fun, a little rest from the
        emptiness of conventional life! That&rsquo;s all right, have your fling
        by all means&mdash;no one will blame you, but to take the thing
        seriously, to get up scenes . . . no, say what you like, I cannot
        understand that! Just fancy, she was jealous! Wasn&rsquo;t that silly?
        One day Mametkul, her grande passion, came to see her . . . she was not
        at home. . . . Well, I asked him into my room . . . there was
        conversation, one thing and another . . . they&rsquo;re awfully amusing,
        you know! The evening passed without our noticing it. . . . All at once
        Yulia rushed in. . . . She flew at me and at Mametkul &mdash;made such a
        scene . . . fi! I can&rsquo;t understand that sort of thing,
        Vassitchka.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vassitchka cleared his throat, frowned, and walked up and down the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You had a gay time there, I must say,&rdquo; he growled with a
        disdainful smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How stu-upid that is!&rdquo; cried Natalya Mihalovna, offended.
        &ldquo;I know what you are thinking about! You always have such horrid
        ideas! I won&rsquo;t tell you anything! No, I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>The lady pouted and said no more.</p>
