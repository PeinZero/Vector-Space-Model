      <p>A PECULIAR MAN</p>

      <p>
        BETWEEN twelve and one at night a tall gentleman, wearing a top-hat and
        a coat with a hood, stops before the door of Marya Petrovna Koshkin, a
        midwife and an old maid. Neither face nor hand can be distinguished in
        the autumn darkness, but in the very manner of his coughing and the
        ringing of the bell a certain solidity, positiveness, and even
        impressiveness can be discerned. After the third ring the door opens and
        Marya Petrovna herself appears. She has a man&rsquo;s overcoat flung on
        over her white petticoat. The little lamp with the green shade which she
        holds in her hand throws a greenish light over her sleepy, freckled
        face, her scraggy neck, and the lank, reddish hair that strays from
        under her cap.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Can I see the midwife?&rdquo; asks the gentleman.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am the midwife. What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        The gentleman walks into the entry and Marya Petrovna sees facing her a
        tall, well-made man, no longer young, but with a handsome, severe face
        and bushy whiskers.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am a collegiate assessor, my name is Kiryakov,&rdquo; he says.
        &ldquo;I came to fetch you to my wife. Only please make haste.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very good . . .&rdquo; the midwife assents. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
        dress at once, and I must trouble you to wait for me in the
        parlour.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kiryakov takes off his overcoat and goes into the parlour. The greenish
        light of the lamp lies sparsely on the cheap furniture in patched white
        covers, on the pitiful flowers and the posts on which ivy is trained. .
        . . There is a smell of geranium and carbolic. The little clock on the
        wall ticks timidly, as though abashed at the presence of a strange man.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am ready,&rdquo; says Marya Petrovna, coming into the room five
        minutes later, dressed, washed, and ready for action. &ldquo;Let us
        go.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you must make haste,&rdquo; says Kiryakov. &ldquo;And, by
        the way, it is not out of place to enquire&mdash;what do you ask for
        your services?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know . . .&rdquo; says Marya Petrovna with
        an embarrassed smile. &ldquo;As much as you will give.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t like that,&rdquo; says Kiryakov, looking coldly
        and steadily at the midwife. &ldquo;An arrangement beforehand is best. I
        don&rsquo;t want to take advantage of you and you don&rsquo;t want to
        take advantage of me. To avoid misunderstandings it is more sensible for
        us to make an arrangement beforehand.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know&mdash;there is no fixed price.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I work myself and am accustomed to respect the work of others. I
        don&rsquo;t like injustice. It will be equally unpleasant to me if I pay
        you too little, or if you demand from me too much, and so I insist on
        your naming your charge.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, there are such different charges.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;H&rsquo;m. In view of your hesitation, which I fail to
        understand, I am constrained to fix the sum myself. I can give you two
        roubles.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Good gracious! . . . Upon my word! . . .&rdquo; says Marya
        Petrovna, turning crimson and stepping back. &ldquo;I am really ashamed.
        Rather than take two roubles I will come for nothing . . . . Five
        roubles, if you like.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Two roubles, not a kopeck more. I don&rsquo;t want to take
        advantage of you, but I do not intend to be overcharged.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;As you please, but I am not coming for two roubles. . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;But by law you have not the right to refuse.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very well, I will come for nothing.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have you for nothing. All work ought to receive
        remuneration. I work myself and I understand that. . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t come for two roubles,&rdquo; Marya Petrovna answers
        mildly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come for nothing if you like.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In that case I regret that I have troubled you for nothing. . . .
        I have the honour to wish you good-bye.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you are a man!&rdquo; says Marya Petrovna, seeing him into
        the entry. &ldquo;I will come for three roubles if that will satisfy
        you.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Kiryakov frowns and ponders for two full minutes, looking with
        concentration on the floor, then he says resolutely, &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
        and goes out into the street. The astonished and disconcerted midwife
        fastens the door after him and goes back into her bedroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s good-looking, respectable, but how queer, God bless
        the man! . . .&rdquo; she thinks as she gets into bed.
      </p>

      <p>
        But in less than half an hour she hears another ring; she gets up and
        sees the same Kiryakov again.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Extraordinary the way things are mismanaged. Neither the chemist,
        nor the police, nor the house-porters can give me the address of a
        midwife, and so I am under the necessity of assenting to your terms. I
        will give you three roubles, but . . . I warn you beforehand that when I
        engage servants or receive any kind of services, I make an arrangement
        beforehand in order that when I pay there may be no talk of extras,
        tips, or anything of the sort. Everyone ought to receive what is his
        due.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Marya Petrovna has not listened to Kiryakov for long, but already she
        feels that she is bored and repelled by him, that his even, measured
        speech lies like a weight on her soul. She dresses and goes out into the
        street with him. The air is still but cold, and the sky is so overcast
        that the light of the street lamps is hardly visible. The sloshy snow
        squelches under their feet. The midwife looks intently but does not see
        a cab.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I suppose it is not far?&rdquo; she asks.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;No, not far,&rdquo; Kiryakov answers grimly.</p>

      <p>
        They walk down one turning, a second, a third. . . . Kiryakov strides
        along, and even in his step his respectability and positiveness is
        apparent.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What awful weather!&rdquo; the midwife observes to him.</p>

      <p>
        But he preserves a dignified silence, and it is noticeable that he tries
        to step on the smooth stones to avoid spoiling his goloshes. At last
        after a long walk the midwife steps into the entry; from which she can
        see a big decently furnished drawing-room. There is not a soul in the
        rooms, even in the bedroom where the woman is lying in labour. . . . The
        old women and relations who flock in crowds to every confinement are not
        to be seen. The cook rushes about alone, with a scared and vacant face.
        There is a sound of loud groans.
      </p>

      <p>
        Three hours pass. Marya Petrovna sits by the mother&rsquo;s bedside and
        whispers to her. The two women have already had time to make friends,
        they have got to know each other, they gossip, they sigh together. . . .
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; says the midwife anxiously, and at
        the same time she showers questions on her.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then the door opens and Kiryakov himself comes quietly and stolidly into
        the room. He sits down in the chair and strokes his whiskers. Silence
        reigns. Marya Petrovna looks timidly at his handsome, passionless,
        wooden face and waits for him to begin to talk, but he remains
        absolutely silent and absorbed in thought. After waiting in vain, the
        midwife makes up her mind to begin herself, and utters a phrase commonly
        used at confinements.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well now, thank God, there is one human being more in the
        world!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s agreeable,&rdquo; said Kiryakov, preserving the
        wooden expression of his face, &ldquo;though indeed, on the other hand,
        to have more children you must have more money. The baby is not born fed
        and clothed.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        A guilty expression comes into the mother&rsquo;s face, as though she
        had brought a creature into the world without permission or through idle
        caprice. Kiryakov gets up with a sigh and walks with solid dignity out
        of the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a man, bless him!&rdquo; says the midwife to the mother.
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so stern and does not smile.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The mother tells her that he is always like that. . . . He is honest,
        fair, prudent, sensibly economical, but all that to such an exceptional
        degree that simple mortals feel suffocated by it. His relations have
        parted from him, the servants will not stay more than a month; they have
        no friends; his wife and children are always on tenterhooks from terror
        over every step they take. He does not shout at them nor beat them, his
        virtues are far more numerous than his defects, but when he goes out of
        the house they all feel better, and more at ease. Why it is so the woman
        herself cannot say.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The basins must be properly washed and put away in the store
        cupboard,&rdquo; says Kiryakov, coming into the bedroom. &ldquo;These
        bottles must be put away too: they may come in handy.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        What he says is very simple and ordinary, but the midwife for some
        reason feels flustered. She begins to be afraid of the man and shudders
        every time she hears his footsteps. In the morning as she is preparing
        to depart she sees Kiryakov&rsquo;s little son, a pale, close-cropped
        schoolboy, in the dining-room drinking his tea. . . . Kiryakov is
        standing opposite him, saying in his flat, even voice:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You know how to eat, you must know how to work too. You have just
        swallowed a mouthful but have not probably reflected that that mouthful
        costs money and money is obtained by work. You must eat and reflect. . .
        .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The midwife looks at the boy&rsquo;s dull face, and it seems to her as
        though the very air is heavy, that a little more and the very walls will
        fall, unable to endure the crushing presence of the peculiar man. Beside
        herself with terror, and by now feeling a violent hatred for the man,
        Marya Petrovna gathers up her bundles and hurriedly departs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Half-way home she remembers that she has forgotten to ask for her three
        roubles, but after stopping and thinking for a minute, with a wave of
        her hand, she goes on.
