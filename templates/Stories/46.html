      <p>IN THE GRAVEYARD</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;THE wind has got up, friends, and it is beginning to get dark.
        Hadn&rsquo;t we better take ourselves off before it gets worse?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The wind was frolicking among the yellow leaves of the old birch trees,
        and a shower of thick drops fell upon us from the leaves. One of our
        party slipped on the clayey soil, and clutched at a big grey cross to
        save himself from falling.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yegor Gryaznorukov, titular councillor and cavalier . .&rdquo; he
        read. &ldquo;I knew that gentleman. He was fond of his wife, he wore the
        Stanislav ribbon, and read nothing. . . . His digestion worked well . .
        . . life was all right, wasn&rsquo;t it? One would have thought he had
        no reason to die, but alas! fate had its eye on him. . . . The poor
        fellow fell a victim to his habits of observation. On one occasion, when
        he was listening at a keyhole, he got such a bang on the head from the
        door that he sustained concussion of the brain (he had a brain), and
        died. And here, under this tombstone, lies a man who from his cradle
        detested verses and epigrams. . . . As though to mock him his whole
        tombstone is adorned with verses. . . . There is someone coming!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        A man in a shabby overcoat, with a shaven, bluish-crimson countenance,
        overtook us. He had a bottle under his arm and a parcel of sausage was
        sticking out of his pocket.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where is the grave of Mushkin, the actor?&rdquo; he asked us in a
        husky voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        We conducted him towards the grave of Mushkin, the actor, who had died
        two years before.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You are a government clerk, I suppose?&rdquo; we asked him.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, an actor. Nowadays it is difficult to distinguish actors from
        clerks of the Consistory. No doubt you have noticed that. . . .
        That&rsquo;s typical, but it&rsquo;s not very flattering for the
        government clerk.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        It was with difficulty that we found the actor&rsquo;s grave. It had
        sunken, was overgrown with weeds, and had lost all appearance of a
        grave. A cheap, little cross that had begun to rot, and was covered with
        green moss blackened by the frost, had an air of aged dejection and
        looked, as it were, ailing.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;. . . forgotten friend Mushkin . . .&rdquo; we read.</p>

      <p>Time had erased the never, and corrected the falsehood of man.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A subscription for a monument to him was got up among actors and
        journalists, but they drank up the money, the dear fellows . . .&rdquo;
        sighed the actor, bowing down to the ground and touching the wet earth
        with his knees and his cap.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;How do you mean, drank it?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        That&rsquo;s very simple. They collected the money, published a
        paragraph about it in the newspaper, and spent it on drink. . . . I
        don&rsquo;t say it to blame them. . . . I hope it did them good, dear
        things! Good health to them, and eternal memory to him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Drinking means bad health, and eternal memory nothing but
        sadness. God give us remembrance for a time, but eternal
        memory&mdash;what next!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are right there. Mushkin was a well-known man, you see; there
        were a dozen wreaths on the coffin, and he is already forgotten. Those
        to whom he was dear have forgotten him, but those to whom he did harm
        remember him. I, for instance, shall never, never forget him, for I got
        nothing but harm from him. I have no love for the deceased.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What harm did he do you?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Great harm,&rdquo; sighed the actor, and an expression of bitter
        resentment overspread his face. &ldquo;To me he was a villain and a
        scoundrel&mdash;the Kingdom of Heaven be his! It was through looking at
        him and listening to him that I became an actor. By his art he lured me
        from the parental home, he enticed me with the excitements of an
        actor&rsquo;s life, promised me all sorts of things&mdash;and brought
        tears and sorrow. . . . An actor&rsquo;s lot is a bitter one! I have
        lost youth, sobriety, and the divine semblance. . . . I haven&rsquo;t a
        half-penny to bless myself with, my shoes are down at heel, my breeches
        are frayed and patched, and my face looks as if it had been gnawed by
        dogs. . . . My head&rsquo;s full of freethinking and nonsense. . . . He
        robbed me of my faith&mdash;my evil genius! It would have been something
        if I had had talent, but as it is, I am ruined for nothing. . . .
        It&rsquo;s cold, honoured friends. . . . Won&rsquo;t you have some?
        There is enough for all. . . . B-r-r-r. . . . Let us drink to the rest
        of his soul! Though I don&rsquo;t like him and though he&rsquo;s dead,
        he was the only one I had in the world, the only one. It&rsquo;s the
        last time I shall visit him. . . . The doctors say I shall soon die of
        drink, so here I have come to say good- bye. One must forgive
        one&rsquo;s enemies.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        We left the actor to converse with the dead Mushkin and went on. It
        began drizzling a fine cold rain.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the turning into the principal avenue strewn with gravel, we met a
        funeral procession. Four bearers, wearing white calico sashes and muddy
        high boots with leaves sticking on them, carried the brown coffin. It
        was getting dark and they hastened, stumbling and shaking their burden.
        . . .
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only been walking here for a couple of hours and that
        is the third brought in already. . . . Shall we go home, friends?&rdquo;
