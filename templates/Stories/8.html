      <h1>DARKNESS</h1>

      <p>
        A YOUNG peasant, with white eyebrows and eyelashes and broad cheekbones,
        in a torn sheepskin and big black felt overboots, waited till the
        Zemstvo doctor had finished seeing his patients and came out to go home
        from the hospital; then he went up to him, diffidently.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Please, your honour,&rdquo; he said.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        The young man passed the palm of his hand up and over his nose, looked
        at the sky, and then answered:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Please, your honour. . . . You&rsquo;ve got my brother Vaska the
        blacksmith from Varvarino in the convict ward here, your honour. . .
        .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, what then?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am Vaska&rsquo;s brother, you see. . . . Father has the two of
        us: him, Vaska, and me, Kirila; besides us there are three sisters, and
        Vaska&rsquo;s a married man with a little one. . . . There are a lot of
        us and no one to work. . . . In the smithy it&rsquo;s nearly two years
        now since the forge has been heated. I am at the cotton factory, I
        can&rsquo;t do smith&rsquo;s work, and how can father work? Let alone
        work, he can&rsquo;t eat properly, he can&rsquo;t lift the spoon to his
        mouth.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What do you want from me?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Be merciful! Let Vaska go!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        The doctor looked wonderingly at Kirila, and without saying a word
        walked on. The young peasant ran on in front and flung himself in a heap
        at his feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Doctor, kind gentleman!&rdquo; he besought him, bAlinking and
        again passing his open hand over his nose. &ldquo;Show heavenly mercy;
        let Vaska go home! We shall remember you in our prayers for ever! Your
        honour, let him go! They are all starving! Mother&rsquo;s wailing day
        in, day out, Vaska&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;s wailing . . . it&rsquo;s worse
        than death! I don&rsquo;t care to look upon the light of day. Be
        merciful; let him go, kind gentleman!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you stupid or out of your senses?&rdquo; asked the doctor
        angrily. &ldquo;How can I let him go? Why, he is a convict.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>Kirila began crying. &ldquo;Let him go!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Tfoo, queer fellow! What right have I? Am I a gaoler or what?
        They brought him to the hospital for me to treat him, but I have as much
        right to let him out as I have to put you in prison, silly
        fellow!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But they have shut him up for nothing! He was in prison a year
        before the trial, and now there is no saying what he is there for. It
        would have been a different thing if he had murdered someone, let us
        say, or stolen horses; but as it is, what is it all about?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Very likely, but how do I come in?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They shut a man up and they don&rsquo;t know themselves what for.
        He was drunk, your honour, did not know what he was doing, and even hit
        father on the ear and scratched his own cheek on a branch, and two of
        our fellows&mdash;they wanted some Turkish tobacco, you see-began
        telling him to go with them and break into the Armenian&rsquo;s shop at
        night for tobacco. Being drunk, he obeyed them, the fool. They broke the
        lock, you know, got in, and did no end of mischief; they turned
        everything upside down, broke the windows, and scattered the flour
        about. They were drunk, that is all one can say! Well, the constable
        turned up . . . and with one thing and another they took them off to the
        magistrate. They have been a whole year in prison, and a week ago, on
        the Wednesday, they were all three tried in the town. A soldier stood
        behind them with a gun . . . people were sworn in. Vaska was less to
        blame than any, but the gentry decided that he was the ringleader. The
        other two lads were sent to prison, but Vaska to a convict battalion for
        three years. And what for? One should judge like a Christian!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have nothing to do with it, I tell you again. Go to the
        authorities.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I have been already! I&rsquo;ve been to the court; I have tried
        to send in a petition&mdash;they wouldn&rsquo;t take a petition; I have
        been to the police captain, and I have been to the examining magistrate,
        and everyone says, &lsquo;It is not my business!&rsquo; Whose business
        is it, then? But there is no one above you here in the hospital; you do
        what you like, your honour.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You simpleton,&rdquo; sighed the doctor, &ldquo;once the jury
        have found him guilty, not the governor, not even the minister, could do
        anything, let alone the police captain. It&rsquo;s no good your trying
        to do anything!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And who judged him, then?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;The gentlemen of the jury. . . .&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t gentlemen, they were our peasants! Andrey
        Guryev was one; Aloshka Huk was one.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, I am cold talking to you. . . .&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        The doctor waved his hand and walked quickly to his own door. Kirila was
        on the point of following him, but, seeing the door slam, he stopped.
      </p>

      <p>
        For ten minutes he stood motionless in the middle of the hospital yard,
        and without putting on his cap stared at the doctor&rsquo;s house, then
        he heaved a deep sigh, slowly scratched himself, and walked towards the
        gate.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To whom am I to go?&rdquo; he muttered as he came out on to the
        road. &ldquo;One says it is not his business, another says it is not his
        business. Whose business is it, then? No, till you grease their hands
        you will get nothing out of them. The doctor says that, but he keeps
        looking all the while at my fist to see whether I am going to give him a
        blue note. Well, brother, I&rsquo;ll go, if it has to be to the
        governor.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Shifting from one foot to the other and continually looking round him in
        an objectless way, he trudged lazily along the road and was apparently
        wondering where to go. . . . It was not cold and the snow faintly
        crunched under his feet. Not more than half a mile in front of him the
        wretched little district town in which his brother had just been tried
        lay outstretched on the hill. On the right was the dark prison with its
        red roof and sentry-boxes at the corners; on the left was the big town
        copse, now covered with hoar-frost. It was still; only an old man,
        wearing a woman&rsquo;s short jacket and a huge cap, was walking ahead,
        coughing and shouting to a cow which he was driving to the town.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Good-day, grandfather,&rdquo; said Kirila, overtaking him.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Good-day. . . .&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Are you driving it to the market?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; the old man answered lazily.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Are you a townsman?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        They got into conversation; Kirila told him what he had come to the
        hospital for, and what he had been talking about to the doctor.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The doctor does not know anything about such matters, that is a
        sure thing,&rdquo; the old man said to him as they were both entering
        the town; &ldquo;though he is a gentleman, he is only taught to cure by
        every means, but to give you real advice, or, let us say, write out a
        petition for you&mdash;that he cannot do. There are special authorities
        to do that. You have been to the justice of the peace and to the police
        captain&mdash;they are no good for your business either.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Where am I to go?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The permanent member of the rural board is the chief person for
        peasants&rsquo; affairs. Go to him, Mr. Sineokov.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;The one who is at Zolotovo?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, yes, at Zolotovo. He is your chief man. If it is anything
        that has to do with you peasants even the police captain has no
        authority against him.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long way to go, old man. . . . I dare say it&rsquo;s
        twelve miles and may be more.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;One who needs something will go seventy.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That is so. . . . Should I send in a petition to him, or
        what?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You will find out there. If you should have a petition the clerk
        will write you one quick enough. The permanent member has a
        clerk.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        After parting from the old man Kirila stood still in the middle of the
        square, thought a little, and walked back out of the town. He made up
        his mind to go to Zolotovo.
      </p>

      <p>
        Five days later, as the doctor was on his way home after seeing his
        patients, he caught sight of Kirila again in his yard. This time the
        young peasant was not alone, but with a gaunt, very pale old man who
        nodded his head without ceasing, like a pendulum, and mumbled with his
        lips.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Your honour, I have come again to ask your gracious mercy,&rdquo;
        began Kirila. &ldquo;Here I have come with my father. Be merciful, let
        Vaska go! The permanent member would not talk to me. He said: &lsquo;Go
        away!&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Your honour,&rdquo; the old man hissed in his throat, raising his
        twitching eyebrows, &ldquo;be merciful! We are poor people, we cannot
        repay your honour, but if you graciously please, Kiryushka or Vaska can
        repay you in work. Let them work.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We will pay with work,&rdquo; said Kirila, and he raised his hand
        above his head as though he would take an oath. &ldquo;Let him go! They
        are starving, they are crying day and night, your honour!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The young peasant bent a rapid glance on his father, pulled him by the
        sleeve, and both of them, as at the word of command, fell at the
        doctor&rsquo;s feet. The latter waved his hand in despair, and, without
        looking round, walked quickly in at his door.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p></p>

      <p>THE BEGGAR</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;KIND sir, be so good as to notice a poor, hungry man. I have not
        tasted food for three days. I have not a five-kopeck piece for a
        night&rsquo;s lodging. I swear by God! For five years I was a village
        schoolmaster and lost my post through the intrigues of the Zemstvo. I
        was the victim of false witness. I have been out of a place for a year
        now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Skvortsov, a Petersburg lawyer, looked at the speaker&rsquo;s tattered
        dark blue overcoat, at his muddy, drunken eyes, at the red patches on
        his cheeks, and it seemed to him that he had seen the man before.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And now I am offered a post in the Kaluga province,&rdquo; the
        beggar continued, &ldquo;but I have not the means for the journey there.
        Graciously help me! I am ashamed to ask, but . . . I am compelled by
        circumstances.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Skvortsov looked at his goloshes, of which one was shallow like a shoe,
        while the other came high up the leg like a boot, and suddenly
        remembered.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen, the day before yesterday I met you in Sadovoy
        Street,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and then you told me, not that you were a
        village schoolmaster, but that you were a student who had been expelled.
        Do you remember?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;N-o. No, that cannot be so!&rdquo; the beggar muttered in
        confusion. &ldquo;I am a village schoolmaster, and if you wish it I can
        show you documents to prove it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough lies! You called yourself a student, and even
        told me what you were expelled for. Do you remember?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Skvortsov flushed, and with a look of disgust on his face turned away
        from the ragged figure.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s contemptible, sir!&rdquo; he cried angrily.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a swindle! I&rsquo;ll hand you over to the police,
        damn you! You are poor and hungry, but that does not give you the right
        to lie so shamelessly!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The ragged figure took hold of the door-handle and, like a bird in a
        snare, looked round the hall desperately.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I . . . I am not lying,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I can show
        documents.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who can believe you?&rdquo; Skvortsov went on, still indignant.
        &ldquo;To exploit the sympathy of the public for village schoolmasters
        and students&mdash;it&rsquo;s so low, so mean, so dirty! It&rsquo;s
        revolting!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Skvortsov flew into a rage and gave the beggar a merciless scolding. The
        ragged fellow&rsquo;s insolent lying aroused his disgust and aversion,
        was an offence against what he, Skvortsov, loved and prized in himself:
        kindliness, a feeling heart, sympathy for the unhappy. By his lying, by
        his treacherous assault upon compassion, the individual had, as it were,
        defiled the charity which he liked to give to the poor with no
        misgivings in his heart. The beggar at first defended himself, protested
        with oaths, then he sank into silence and hung his head, overcome with
        shame.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; he said, laying his hand on his heart, &ldquo;I
        really was . . . lying! I am not a student and not a village
        schoolmaster. All that&rsquo;s mere invention! I used to be in the
        Russian choir, and I was turned out of it for drunkenness. But what can
        I do? Believe me, in God&rsquo;s name, I can&rsquo;t get on without
        lying&mdash;when I tell the truth no one will give me anything. With the
        truth one may die of hunger and freeze without a night&rsquo;s lodging!
        What you say is true, I understand that, but . . . what am I to
        do?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What are you to do? You ask what are you to do?&rdquo; cried
        Skvortsov, going close up to him. &ldquo;Work&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
        you must do! You must work!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Work. . . . I know that myself, but where can I get work?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nonsense. You are young, strong, and healthy, and could always
        find work if you wanted to. But you know you are lazy, pampered,
        drunken! You reek of vodka like a pothouse! You have become false and
        corrupt to the marrow of your bones and fit for nothing but begging and
        lying! If you do graciously condescend to take work, you must have a job
        in an office, in the Russian choir, or as a billiard-marker, where you
        will have a salary and have nothing to do! But how would you like to
        undertake manual labour? I&rsquo;ll be bound, you wouldn&rsquo;t be a
        house porter or a factory hand! You are too genteel for that!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What things you say, really . . .&rdquo; said the beggar, and he
        gave a bitter smile. &ldquo;How can I get manual work? It&rsquo;s rather
        late for me to be a shopman, for in trade one has to begin from a boy;
        no one would take me as a house porter, because I am not of that class .
        . . . And I could not get work in a factory; one must know a trade, and
        I know nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Nonsense! You always find some justification! Wouldn&rsquo;t you
        like to chop wood?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I would not refuse to, but the regular woodchoppers are out of
        work now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, all idlers argue like that! As soon as you are offered
        anything you refuse it. Would you care to chop wood for me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Certainly I will. . .&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very good, we shall see. . . . Excellent. We&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;
        Skvortsov, in nervous haste; and not without malignant pleasure, rubbing
        his hands, summoned his cook from the kitchen.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here, Olga,&rdquo; he said to her, &ldquo;take this gentleman to
        the shed and let him chop some wood.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The beggar shrugged his shoulders as though puzzled, and irresolutely
        followed the cook. It was evident from his demeanour that he had
        consented to go and chop wood, not because he was hungry and wanted to
        earn money, but simply from shame and amour propre, because he had been
        taken at his word. It was clear, too, that he was suffering from the
        effects of vodka, that he was unwell, and felt not the faintest
        inclination to work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Skvortsov hurried into the dining-room. There from the window which
        looked out into the yard he could see the woodshed and everything that
        happened in the yard. Standing at the window, Skvortsov saw the cook and
        the beggar come by the back way into the yard and go through the muddy
        snow to the woodshed. Olga scrutinized her companion angrily, and
        jerking her elbow unlocked the woodshed and angrily banged the door
        open.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Most likely we interrupted the woman drinking her coffee,&rdquo;
        thought Skvortsov. &ldquo;What a cross creature she is!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Then he saw the pseudo-schoolmaster and pseudo-student seat himself on a
        block of wood, and, leaning his red cheeks upon his fists, sink into
        thought. The cook flung an axe at his feet, spat angrily on the ground,
        and, judging by the expression of her lips, began abusing him. The
        beggar drew a log of wood towards him irresolutely, set it up between
        his feet, and diffidently drew the axe across it. The log toppled and
        fell over. The beggar drew it towards him, breathed on his frozen hands,
        and again drew the axe along it as cautiously as though he were afraid
        of its hitting his golosh or chopping off his fingers. The log fell over
        again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Skvortsov&rsquo;s wrath had passed off by now, he felt sore and ashamed
        at the thought that he had forced a pampered, drunken, and perhaps sick
        man to do hard, rough work in the cold.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Never mind, let him go on . . .&rdquo; he thought, going from the
        dining-room into his study. &ldquo;I am doing it for his good!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        An hour later Olga appeared and announced that the wood had been chopped
        up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here, give him half a rouble,&rdquo; said Skvortsov. &ldquo;If he
        likes, let him come and chop wood on the first of every month. . . .
        There will always be work for him.&rdquo;

        On the first of the month the beggar turned up and again earned half a
        rouble, though he could hardly stand. From that time forward he took to
        turning up frequently, and work was always found for him: sometimes he
        would sweep the snow into heaps, or clear up the shed, at another he
        used to beat the rugs and the mattresses. He always received thirty to
        forty kopecks for his work, and on one occasion an old pair of trousers
        was sent out to him.

      <p>
        When he moved, Skvortsov engaged him to assist in packing and moving the
        furniture. On this occasion the beggar was sober, gloomy, and silent; he
        scarcely touched the furniture, walked with hanging head behind the
        furniture vans, and did not even try to appear busy; he merely shivered
        with the cold, and was overcome with confusion when the men with the
        vans laughed at his idleness, feebleness, and ragged coat that had once
        been a gentleman&rsquo;s. After the removal Skvortsov sent for him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I see my words have had an effect upon you,&rdquo; he said,
        giving him a rouble. &ldquo;This is for your work. I see that you are
        sober and not disinclined to work. What is your name?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Lushkov.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can offer you better work, not so rough, Lushkov. Can you
        write?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then go with this note to-morrow to my colleague and he will give
        you some copying to do. Work, don&rsquo;t drink, and don&rsquo;t forget
        what I said to you. Good-bye.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Skvortsov, pleased that he had put a man in the path of rectitude,
        patted Lushkov genially on the shoulder, and even shook hands with him
        at parting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lushkov took the letter, departed, and from that time forward did not
        come to the back-yard for work.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two years passed. One day as Skvortsov was standing at the ticket-office
        of a theatre, paying for his ticket, he saw beside him a little man with
        a lambskin collar and a shabby cat&rsquo;s-skin cap. The man timidly
        asked the clerk for a gallery ticket and paid for it with kopecks.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Lushkov, is it you?&rdquo; asked Skvortsov, recognizing in the
        little man his former woodchopper. &ldquo;Well, what are you doing? Are
        you getting on all right?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Pretty well. . . . I am in a notary&rsquo;s office now. I earn
        thirty-five roubles.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, thank God, that&rsquo;s capital. I rejoice for you. I am
        very, very glad, Lushkov. You know, in a way, you are my godson. It was
        I who shoved you into the right way. Do you remember what a scolding I
        gave you, eh? You almost sank through the floor that time. Well, thank
        you, my dear fellow, for remembering my words.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you too,&rdquo; said Lushkov. &ldquo;If I had not come to
        you that day, maybe I should be calling myself a schoolmaster or a
        student still. Yes, in your house I was saved, and climbed out of the
        pit.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I am very, very glad.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you for your kind words and deeds. What you said that day
        was excellent. I am grateful to you and to your cook, God bless that
        kind, noble-hearted woman. What you said that day was excellent; I am
        indebted to you as long as I live, of course, but it was your cook,
        Olga, who really saved me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, it was like this. I used to come to you to chop wood and she
        would begin: &lsquo;Ah, you drunkard! You God-forsaken man! And yet
        death does not take you!&rsquo; and then she would sit opposite me,
        lamenting, looking into my face and wailing: &lsquo;You unlucky fellow!
        You have no gladness in this world, and in the next you will burn in
        hell, poor drunkard! You poor sorrowful creature!&rsquo; and she always
        went on in that style, you know. How often she upset herself, and how
        many tears she shed over me I can&rsquo;t tell you. But what affected me
        most&mdash;she chopped the wood for me! Do you know, sir, I never
        chopped a single log for you&mdash;she did it all! How it was she saved
        me, how it was I changed, looking at her, and gave up drinking, I
        can&rsquo;t explain. I only know that what she said and the noble way
        she behaved brought about a change in my soul, and I shall never forget
        it. It&rsquo;s time to go up, though, they are just going to ring the
        bell.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>Lushkov bowed and went off to the gallery.</p>
