      <h1>A SLANDER</h1>

      <p>
        SERGE KAPITONICH AHINEEV, the writing master, was marrying his daughter
        to the teacher of history and geography. The wedding festivities were
        going off most successfully. In the drawing room there was singing,
        playing, and dancing. Waiters hired from the club were flitting
        distractedly about the rooms, dressed in black swallow-tails and dirty
        white ties. There was a continual hubbub and din of conversation.
        Sitting side by side on the sofa, the teacher of mathematics,
        Tarantulov, the French teacher, Pasdequoi, and the junior assessor of
        taxes, Mzda, were talking hurriedly and interrupting one another as they
        described to the guests cases of persons being buried alive, and gave
        their opinions on spiritualism. None of them believed in spiritualism,
        but all admitted that there were many things in this world which would
        always be beyond the mind of man. In the next room the literature
        master, Dodonsky, was explaining to the visitors the cases in which a
        sentry has the right to fire on passers-by. The subjects, as you
        perceive, were alarming, but very agreeable. Persons whose social
        position precluded them from entering were looking in at the windows
        from the yard.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just at midnight the master of the house went into the kitchen to see
        whether everything was ready for supper. The kitchen from floor to
        ceiling was filled with fumes composed of goose, duck, and many other
        odours. On two tables the accessories, the drinks and light
        refreshments, were set out in artistic disorder. The cook, Marfa, a red-
        faced woman whose figure was like a barrel with a belt around it, was
        bustling about the tables.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Show me the sturgeon, Marfa,&rdquo; said Ahineev, rubbing his
        hands and licking his lips. &ldquo;What a perfume! I could eat up the
        whole kitchen. Come, show me the sturgeon.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Marfa went up to one of the benches and cautiously lifted a piece of
        greasy newspaper. Under the paper on an immense dish there reposed a
        huge sturgeon, masked in jelly and decorated with capers, olives, and
        carrots. Ahineev gazed at the sturgeon and gasped. His face beamed, he
        turned his eyes up. He bent down and with his lips emitted the sound of
        an ungreased wheel. After standing a moment he snapped his fingers with
        delight and once more smacked his lips.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah-ah! the sound of a passionate kiss. . . . Who is it
        you&rsquo;re kissing out there, little Marfa?&rdquo; came a voice from
        the next room, and in the doorway there appeared the cropped head of the
        assistant usher, Vankin. &ldquo;Who is it? A-a-h! . . . Delighted to
        meet you! Sergei Kapitonich! You&rsquo;re a fine grandfather, I must
        say! T&Atilde;&ordf;te-&Atilde; -t&Atilde;&ordf;te with the fair
        sex&mdash;tette!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not kissing,&rdquo; said Ahineev in confusion.
        &ldquo;Who told you so, you fool? I was only . . . I smacked my lips . .
        . in reference to . . . as an indication of . . . pleasure . . . at the
        sight of the fish.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell that to the marines!&rdquo; The intrusive face vanished,
        wearing a broad grin.
      </p>

      <p>Ahineev flushed.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Hang it!&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;the beast will go now and talk
        scandal. He&rsquo;ll disgrace me to all the town, the brute.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Ahineev went timidly into the drawing-room and looked stealthily round
        for Vankin. Vankin was standing by the piano, and, bending down with a
        jaunty air, was whispering something to the inspector&rsquo;s
        sister-in-law, who was laughing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Talking about me!&rdquo; thought Ahineev. &ldquo;About me, blast
        him! And she believes it . . . believes it! She laughs! Mercy on us! No,
        I can&rsquo;t let it pass . . . I can&rsquo;t. I must do something to
        prevent his being believed. . . . I&rsquo;ll speak to them all, and
        he&rsquo;ll be shown up for a fool and a gossip.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Ahineev scratched his head, and still overcome with embarrassment, went
        up to Pasdequoi.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been in the kitchen to see after the
        supper,&rdquo; he said to the Frenchman. &ldquo;I know you are fond of
        fish, and I&rsquo;ve a sturgeon, my dear fellow, beyond everything! A
        yard and a half long! Ha, ha, ha! And, by the way . . . I was just
        forgetting. . . . In the kitchen just now, with that sturgeon . . .
        quite a little story! I went into the kitchen just now and wanted to
        look at the supper dishes. I looked at the sturgeon and I smacked my
        lips with relish . . . at the piquancy of it. And at the very moment
        that fool Vankin came in and said: . . . &lsquo;Ha, ha, ha! . . . So
        you&rsquo;re kissing here!&rsquo; Kissing Marfa, the cook! What a thing
        to imagine, silly fool! The woman is a perfect fright, like all the
        beasts put together, and he talks about kissing! Queer fish!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a queer fish?&rdquo; asked Tarantulov, coming up.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why he, over there&mdash;Vankin! I went into the kitchen . .
        .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he told the story of Vankin. &ldquo;. . . He amused me, queer fish!
        I&rsquo;d rather kiss a dog than Marfa, if you ask me,&rdquo; added
        Ahineev. He looked round and saw behind him Mzda.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We were talking of Vankin,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Queer fish, he
        is! He went into the kitchen, saw me beside Marfa, and began inventing
        all sorts of silly stories. &lsquo;Why are you kissing?&rsquo; he says.
        He must have had a drop too much. &lsquo;And I&rsquo;d rather kiss a
        turkeycock than Marfa,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;And I&rsquo;ve a wife of my
        own, you fool,&rsquo; said I. He did amuse me!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who amused you?&rdquo; asked the priest who taught Scripture in
        the school, going up to Ahineev.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Vankin. I was standing in the kitchen, you know, looking at the
        sturgeon. . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And so on. Within half an hour or so all the guests knew the incident of
        the sturgeon and Vankin.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Let him tell away now!&rdquo; thought Ahineev, rubbing his hands.
        &ldquo;Let him! He&rsquo;ll begin telling his story and they&rsquo;ll
        say to him at once, &lsquo;Enough of your improbable nonsense, you fool,
        we know all about it!&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And Ahineev was so relieved that in his joy he drank four glasses too
        many. After escorting the young people to their room, he went to bed and
        slept like an innocent babe, and next day he thought no more of the
        incident with the sturgeon. But, alas! man proposes, but God disposes.
        An evil tongue did its evil work, and Ahineev&rsquo;s strategy was of no
        avail. Just a week later&mdash;to be precise, on Wednesday after the
        third lesson&mdash;when Ahineev was standing in the middle of the
        teacher&rsquo;s room, holding forth on the vicious propensities of a boy
        called Visekin, the head master went up to him and drew him aside:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Look here, Sergei Kapitonich,&rdquo; said the head master,
        &ldquo;you must excuse me. . . . It&rsquo;s not my business; but all the
        same I must make you realize. . . . It&rsquo;s my duty. You see, there
        are rumors that you are romancing with that . . . cook. . . . It&rsquo;s
        nothing to do with me, but . . . flirt with her, kiss her . . . as you
        please, but don&rsquo;t let it be so public, please. I entreat you!
        Don&rsquo;t forget that you&rsquo;re a schoolmaster.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Ahineev turned cold and faint. He went home like a man stung by a whole
        swarm of bees, like a man scalded with boiling water. As he walked home,
        it seemed to him that the whole town was looking at him as though he
        were smeared with pitch. At home fresh trouble awaited him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you gobbling up your food as usual?&rdquo; his
        wife asked him at dinner. &ldquo;What are you so pensive about? Brooding
        over your amours? Pining for your Marfa? I know all about it,
        Mohammedan! Kind friends have opened my eyes! O-o-o! . . . you
        savage!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And she slapped him in the face. He got up from the table, not feeling
        the earth under his feet, and without his hat or coat, made his way to
        Vankin. He found him at home.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You scoundrel!&rdquo; he addressed him. &ldquo;Why have you
        covered me with mud before all the town? Why did you set this slander
        going about me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What slander? What are you talking about?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Who was it gossiped of my kissing Marfa? Wasn&rsquo;t it you?
        Tell me that. Wasn&rsquo;t it you, you brigand?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vankin bAlinked and twitched in every fibre of his battered countenance,
        raised his eyes to the icon and articulated, &ldquo;God blast me! Strike
        me blind and lay me out, if I said a single word about you! May I be
        left without house and home, may I be stricken with worse than
        cholera!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Vankin&rsquo;s sincerity did not admit of doubt. It was evidently not he
        who was the author of the slander.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;But who, then, who?&rdquo; Ahineev wondered, going over all his
        acquaintances in his mind and beating himself on the breast. &ldquo;Who,
        then?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>Who, then? We, too, ask the reader.</p>
