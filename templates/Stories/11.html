      <h1>FROST</h1>

      <p>
        A &ldquo;POPULAR&rdquo; f&Atilde;&ordf;te with a philanthropic object
        had been arranged on the Feast of Epiphany in the provincial town of
        N&mdash;&mdash;. They had selected a broad part of the river between the
        market and the bishop&rsquo;s palace, fenced it round with a rope, with
        fir-trees and with flags, and provided everything necessary for skating,
        sledging, and tobogganing. The festivity was organized on the grandest
        scale possible. The notices that were distributed were of huge size and
        promised a number of delights: skating, a military band, a lottery with
        no blank tickets, an electric sun, and so on. But the whole scheme
        almost came to nothing owing to the hard frost. From the eve of Epiphany
        there were twenty-eight degrees of frost with a strong wind; it was
        proposed to put off the f&Atilde;&ordf;te, and this was not done only
        because the public, which for a long while had been looking forward to
        the f&Atilde;&ordf;te impatiently, would not consent to any
        postponement.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Only think, what do you expect in winter but a frost!&rdquo; said
        the ladies persuading the governor, who tried to insist that the
        f&Atilde;&ordf;te should be postponed. &ldquo;If anyone is cold he can
        go and warm himself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The trees, the horses, the men&rsquo;s beards were white with frost; it
        even seemed that the air itself crackled, as though unable to endure the
        cold; but in spite of that the frozen public were skating. Immediately
        after the blessing of the waters and precisely at one o&rsquo;clock the
        military band began playing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Between three and four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, when the
        festivity was at its height, the select society of the place gathered
        together to warm themselves in the governor&rsquo;s pavilion, which had
        been put up on the river-bank. The old governor and his wife, the
        bishop, the president of the local court, the head master of the high
        school, and many others, were there. The ladies were sitting in
        armchairs, while the men crowded round the wide glass door, looking at
        the skating.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Holy Saints!&rdquo; said the bishop in surprise; &ldquo;what
        flourishes they execute with their legs! Upon my soul, many a singer
        couldn&rsquo;t do a twirl with his voice as those cut-throats do with
        their legs. Aie! he&rsquo;ll kill himself!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Smirnov. . . . That&rsquo;s Gruzdev . . .&rdquo;
        said the head master, mentioning the names of the schoolboys who flew by
        the pavilion.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Bah! he&rsquo;s all alive-oh!&rdquo; laughed the governor.
        &ldquo;Look, gentlemen, our mayor is coming. . . . He is coming this
        way. . . . That&rsquo;s a nuisance, he will talk our heads off
        now.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        A little thin old man, wearing a big cap and a fur-lined coat hanging
        open, came from the opposite bank towards the pavilion, avoiding the
        skaters. This was the mayor of the town, a merchant, Eremeyev by name, a
        millionaire and an old inhabitant of N&mdash;&mdash;. Flinging wide his
        arms and shrugging at the cold, he skipped along, knocking one golosh
        against the other, evidently in haste to get out of the wind. Half-way
        he suddenly bent down, stole up to some lady, and plucked at her sleeve
        from behind. When she looked round he skipped away, and probably
        delighted at having succeeded in frightening her, went off into a loud,
        aged laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Lively old fellow,&rdquo; said the governor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
        wonder he&rsquo;s not skating.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        As he got near the pavilion the mayor fell into a little tripping trot,
        waved his hands, and, taking a run, slid along the ice in his huge
        golosh boots up to the very door.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yegor Ivanitch, you ought to get yourself some skates!&rdquo; the
        governor greeted him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I am thinking,&rdquo; he answered in a
        squeaky, somewhat nasal tenor, taking off his cap. &ldquo;I wish you
        good health, your Excellency! Your Holiness! Long life to all the other
        gentlemen and ladies! Here&rsquo;s a frost! Yes, it is a frost, bother
        it! It&rsquo;s deadly!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Winking with his red, frozen eyes, Yegor Ivanitch stamped on the floor
        with his golosh boots and swung his arms together like a frozen cabman.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Such a damnable frost, worse than any dog!&rdquo; he went on
        talking, smiling all over his face. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a real
        affliction!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s healthy,&rdquo; said the governor; &ldquo;frost
        strengthens a man and makes him vigorous. . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Though it may be healthy, it would be better without it at
        all,&rdquo; said the mayor, wiping his wedge-shaped beard with a red
        handkerchief. &ldquo;It would be a good riddance! To my thinking, your
        Excellency, the Lord sends it us as a punishment&mdash;the frost, I
        mean. We sin in the summer and are punished in the winter. . . .
        Yes!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>Yegor Ivanitch looked round him quickly and flung up his hands.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, where&rsquo;s the needful . . . to warm us up?&rdquo; he
        asked, looking in alarm first at the governor and then at the bishop.
        &ldquo;Your Excellency! Your Holiness! I&rsquo;ll be bound, the ladies
        are frozen too! We must have something, this won&rsquo;t do!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone began gesticulating and declaring that they had not come to the
        skating to warm themselves, but the mayor, heeding no one, opened the
        door and beckoned to someone with his crooked finger. A workman and a
        fireman ran up to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here, run off to Savatin,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;and tell him
        to make haste and send here . . . what do you call it? . . .
        What&rsquo;s it to be? Tell him to send a dozen glasses . . . a dozen
        glasses of mulled wine, the very hottest, or punch, perhaps. . .
        .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>There was laughter in the pavilion.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;A nice thing to treat us to!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Never mind, we will drink it,&rdquo; muttered the mayor; &ldquo;a
        dozen glasses, then . . . and some Benedictine, perhaps . . . and tell
        them to warm two bottles of red wine. . . . Oh, and what for the ladies?
        Well, you tell them to bring cakes, nuts . . . sweets of some sort,
        perhaps. . . . There, run along, look sharp!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The mayor was silent for a minute and then began again abusing the
        frost, banging his arms across his chest and thumping with his golosh
        boots.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;No, Yegor Ivanitch,&rdquo; said the governor persuasively,
        &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be unfair, the Russian frost has its charms. I was
        reading lately that many of the good qualities of the Russian people are
        due to the vast expanse of their land and to the climate, the cruel
        struggle for existence . . . that&rsquo;s perfectly true!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It may be true, your Excellency, but it would be better without
        it. The frost did drive out the French, of course, and one can freeze
        all sorts of dishes, and the children can go skating&mdash;that&rsquo;s
        all true! For the man who is well fed and well clothed the frost is only
        a pleasure, but for the working man, the beggar, the pilgrim, the crazy
        wanderer, it&rsquo;s the greatest evil and misfortune. It&rsquo;s
        misery, your Holiness! In a frost like this poverty is twice as hard,
        and the thief is more cunning and evildoers more violent. There&rsquo;s
        no gainsaying it! I am turned seventy, I&rsquo;ve a fur coat now, and at
        home I have a stove and rums and punches of all sorts. The frost means
        nothing to me now; I take no notice of it, I don&rsquo;t care to know of
        it, but how it used to be in old days, Holy Mother! It&rsquo;s dreadful
        to recall it! My memory is failing me with years and I have forgotten
        everything; my enemies, and my sins and troubles of all sorts&mdash;I
        forget them all, but the frost&mdash;ough! How I remember it! When my
        mother died I was left a little devil&mdash;this high&mdash;a homeless
        orphan . . . no kith nor kin, wretched, ragged, little clothes, hungry,
        nowhere to sleep&mdash;in fact, &lsquo;we have here no abiding city, but
        seek the one to come.&rsquo; In those days I used to lead an old blind
        woman about the town for five kopecks a day . . . the frosts were cruel,
        wicked. One would go out with the old woman and begin suffering
        torments. My Creator! First of all you would be shivering as in a fever,
        shrugging and dancing about. Then your ears, your fingers, your feet,
        would begin aching. They would ache as though someone were squeezing
        them with pincers. But all that would have been nothing, a trivial
        matter, of no great consequence. The trouble was when your whole body
        was chilled. One would walk for three blessed hours in the frost, your
        Holiness, and lose all human semblance. Your legs are drawn up, there is
        a weight on your chest, your stomach is pinched; above all, there is a
        pain in your heart that is worse than anything. Your heart aches beyond
        all endurance, and there is a wretchedness all over your body as though
        you were leading Death by the hand instead of an old woman. You are numb
        all over, turned to stone like a statue; you go on and feel as though it
        were not you walking, but someone else moving your legs instead of you.
        When your soul is frozen you don&rsquo;t know what you are doing: you
        are ready to leave the old woman with no one to guide her, or to pull a
        hot roll from off a hawker&rsquo;s tray, or to fight with someone. And
        when you come to your night&rsquo;s lodging into the warmth after the
        frost, there is not much joy in that either! You lie awake till
        midnight, crying, and don&rsquo;t know yourself what you are crying for.
        . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We must walk about the skating-ground before it gets dark,&rdquo;
        said the governor&rsquo;s wife, who was bored with listening.
        &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s coming with me?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The governor&rsquo;s wife went out and the whole company trooped out of
        the pavilion after her. Only the governor, the bishop, and the mayor
        remained.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Queen of Heaven! and what I went through when I was a shopboy in
        a fish-shop!&rdquo; Yegor Ivanitch went on, flinging up his arms so that
        his fox-lined coat fell open. &ldquo;One would go out to the shop almost
        before it was light . . . by eight o&rsquo;clock I was completely
        frozen, my face was blue, my fingers were stiff so that I could not
        fasten my buttons nor count the money. One would stand in the cold, turn
        numb, and think, &lsquo;Lord, I shall have to stand like this right on
        till evening!&rsquo; By dinner-time my stomach was pinched and my heart
        was aching. . . . Yes! And I was not much better afterwards when I had a
        shop of my own. The frost was intense and the shop was like a mouse-trap
        with draughts blowing in all directions; the coat I had on was, pardon
        me, mangy, as thin as paper, threadbare. . . . One would be chilled
        through and through, half dazed, and turn as cruel as the frost oneself:
        I would pull one by the ear so that I nearly pulled the ear off; I would
        smack another on the back of the head; I&rsquo;d glare at a customer
        like a ruffian, a wild beast, and be ready to fleece him; and when I got
        home in the evening and ought to have gone to bed, I&rsquo;d be
        ill-humoured and set upon my family, throwing it in their teeth that
        they were living upon me; I would make a row and carry on so that half a
        dozen policemen couldn&rsquo;t have managed me. The frost makes one
        spiteful and drives one to drink.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>Yegor Ivanitch clasped his hands and went on:</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And when we were taking fish to Moscow in the winter, Holy
        Mother!&rdquo; And spluttering as he talked, he began describing the
        horrors he endured with his shopmen when he was taking fish to Moscow. .
        . .
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; sighed the governor, &ldquo;it is wonderful what a
        man can endure! You used to take wagon-loads of fish to Moscow, Yegor
        Ivanitch, while I in my time was at the war. I remember one
        extraordinary instance. . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And the governor described how, during the last Russo-Turkish War, one
        frosty night the division in which he was had stood in the snow without
        moving for thirteen hours in a piercing wind; from fear of being
        observed the division did not light a fire, nor make a sound or a
        movement; they were forbidden to smoke. . . .
      </p>

      <p>
        Reminiscences followed. The governor and the mayor grew lively and good-
        humoured, and, interrupting each other, began recalling their
        experiences. And the bishop told them how, when he was serving in
        Siberia, he had travelled in a sledge drawn by dogs; how one day, being
        drowsy, in a time of sharp frost he had fallen out of the sledge and
        been nearly frozen; when the Tunguses turned back and found him he was
        barely alive. Then, as by common agreement, the old men suddenly sank
        into silence, sat side by side, and mused.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ech!&rdquo; whispered the mayor; &ldquo;you&rsquo;d think it
        would be time to forget, but when you look at the water-carriers, at the
        schoolboys, at the convicts in their wretched gowns, it brings it all
        back! Why, only take those musicians who are playing now. I&rsquo;ll be
        bound, there is a pain in their hearts; a pinch at their stomachs, and
        their trumpets are freezing to their lips. . . . They play and think:
        &lsquo;Holy Mother! we have another three hours to sit here in the
        cold.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The old men sank into thought. They thought of that in man which is
        higher than good birth, higher than rank and wealth and learning, of
        that which brings the lowest beggar near to God: of the helplessness of
        man, of his sufferings and his patience. . . .
      </p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile the air was turning blue . . . the door opened and two waiters
        from Savatin&rsquo;s walked in, carrying trays and a big muffled teapot.
        When the glasses had been filled and there was a strong smell of
        cinnamon and clove in the air, the door opened again, and there came
        into the pavilion a beardless young policeman whose nose was crimson,
        and who was covered all over with frost; he went up to the governor,
        and, saluting, said: &ldquo;Her Excellency told me to inform you that
        she has gone home.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at the way the policeman put his stiff, frozen fingers to his
        cap, looking at his nose, his lustreless eyes, and his hood covered with
        white frost near the mouth, they all for some reason felt that this
        policeman&rsquo;s heart must be aching, that his stomach must feel
        pinched, and his soul numb. . . .
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said the governor hesitatingly, &ldquo;have a drink
        of mulled wine!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right . . . it&rsquo;s all right! Drink it
        up!&rdquo; the mayor urged him, gesticulating; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be
        shy!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The policeman took the glass in both hands, moved aside, and, trying to
        drink without making any sound, began discreetly sipping from the glass.
        He drank and was overwhelmed with embarrassment while the old men looked
        at him in silence, and they all fancied that the pain was leaving the
        young policeman&rsquo;s heart, and that his soul was thawing. The
        governor heaved a sigh.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we were at home,&rdquo; he said, getting up.
        &ldquo;Good-bye! I say,&rdquo; he added, addressing the policeman,
        &ldquo;tell the musicians there to . . . leave off playing, and ask
        Pavel Semyonovitch from me to see they are given . . . beer or
        vodka.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The governor and the bishop said good-bye to the mayor and went out of
        the pavilion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yegor Ivanitch attacked the mulled wine, and before the policeman had
        finished his glass succeeded in telling him a great many interesting
        things. He could not be silent.
