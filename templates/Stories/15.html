      <h1>AN AVENGER</h1>

      <p>
        SHORTLY after finding his wife in flagrante delicto Fyodor Fyodorovitch
        Sigaev was standing in Schmuck and Co.&lsquo;s, the gunsmiths, selecting
        a suitable revolver. His countenance expressed wrath, grief, and
        unalterable determination.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know what I must do,&rdquo; he was thinking. &ldquo;The
        sanctities of the home are outraged, honour is trampled in the mud, vice
        is triumphant, and therefore as a citizen and a man of honour I must be
        their avenger. First, I will kill her and her lover and then
        myself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He had not yet chosen a revolver or killed anyone, but already in
        imagination he saw three bloodstained corpses, broken skulls, brains
        oozing from them, the commotion, the crowd of gaping spectators, the
        post-mortem. . . . With the malignant joy of an insulted man he pictured
        the horror of the relations and the public, the agony of the traitress,
        and was mentally reading leading articles on the destruction of the
        traditions of the home.
      </p>

      <p>
        The shopman, a sprightly little Frenchified figure with rounded belly
        and white waistcoat, displayed the revolvers, and smiling respectfully
        and scraping with his little feet observed:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;. . . I would advise you, M&rsquo;sieur, to take this superb
        revolver, the Smith and Wesson pattern, the last word in the science of
        firearms: triple-action, with ejector, kills at six hundred paces,
        central sight. Let me draw your attention, M&rsquo;sieu, to the beauty
        of the finish. The most fashionable system, M&rsquo;sieu. We sell a
        dozen every day for burglars, wolves, and lovers. Very correct and
        powerful action, hits at a great distance, and kills wife and lover with
        one bullet. As for suicide, M&rsquo;sieu, I don&rsquo;t know a better
        pattern.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The shopman pulled and cocked the trigger, breathed on the barrel, took
        aim, and affected to be breathless with delight. Looking at his ecstatic
        countenance, one might have supposed that he would readily have put a
        bullet through his brains if he had only possessed a revolver of such a
        superb pattern as a Smith-Wesson.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And what price?&rdquo; asked Sigaev.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Forty-five roubles, M&rsquo;sieu.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Mm! . . . that&rsquo;s too dear for me.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In that case, M&rsquo;sieu, let me offer you another make,
        somewhat cheaper. Here, if you&rsquo;ll kindly look, we have an immense
        choice, at all prices. . . . Here, for instance, this revolver of the
        Lefaucher pattern costs only eighteen roubles, but . . .&rdquo; (the
        shopman pursed up his face contemptuously) &ldquo;. . . but,
        M&rsquo;sieu, it&rsquo;s an old-fashioned make. They are only bought by
        hysterical ladies or the mentally deficient. To commit suicide or shoot
        one&rsquo;s wife with a Lefaucher revolver is considered bad form
        nowadays. Smith-Wesson is the only pattern that&rsquo;s correct
        style.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to shoot myself or to kill anyone,&rdquo; said
        Sigaev, lying sullenly. &ldquo;I am buying it simply for a country
        cottage . . . to frighten away burglars. . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not our business, what object you have in buying
        it.&rdquo; The shopman smiled, dropping his eyes discreetly. &ldquo;If
        we were to investigate the object in each case, M&rsquo;sieu, we should
        have to close our shop. To frighten burglars Lefaucher is not a suitable
        pattern, M&rsquo;sieu, for it goes off with a faint, muffled sound. I
        would suggest Mortimer&rsquo;s, the so-called duelling pistol. . .
        .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t I challenge him to a duel?&rdquo; flashed through
        Sigaev&rsquo;s mind. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s doing him too much honour,
        though. . . . Beasts like that are killed like dogs. . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The shopman, swaying gracefully and tripping to and fro on his little
        feet, still smiling and chattering, displayed before him a heap of
        revolvers. The most inviting and impressive of all was the Smith and
        Wesson&rsquo;s. Sigaev picked up a pistol of that pattern, gazed blankly
        at it, and sank into brooding. His imagination pictured how he would
        blow out their brains, how blood would flow in streams over the rug and
        the parquet, how the traitress&rsquo;s legs would twitch in her last
        agony. . . . But that was not enough for his indignant soul. The picture
        of blood, wailing, and horror did not satisfy him. He must think of
        something more terrible.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know! I&rsquo;ll kill myself and him,&rdquo; he thought,
        &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll leave her alive. Let her pine away from the stings
        of conscience and the contempt of all surrounding her. For a sensitive
        nature like hers that will be far more agonizing than death.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        And he imagined his own funeral: he, the injured husband, lies in his
        coffin with a gentle smile on his lips, and she, pale, tortured by
        remorse, follows the coffin like a Niobe, not knowing where to hide
        herself to escape from the withering, contemptuous looks cast upon her
        by the indignant crowd.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I see, M&rsquo;sieu, that you like the Smith and Wesson
        make,&rdquo; the shopman broke in upon his broodings. &ldquo;If you
        think it too dear, very well, I&rsquo;ll knock off five roubles. . . .
        But we have other makes, cheaper.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The little Frenchified figure turned gracefully and took down another
        dozen cases of revolvers from the shelf.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here, M&rsquo;sieu, price thirty roubles. That&rsquo;s not
        expensive, especially as the rate of exchange has dropped terribly and
        the Customs duties are rising every hour. M&rsquo;sieu, I vow I am a
        Conservative, but even I am beginning to murmur. Why, with the rate of
        exchange and the Customs tariff, only the rich can purchase firearms.
        There&rsquo;s nothing left for the poor but Tula weapons and phosphorus
        matches, and Tula weapons are a misery! You may aim at your wife with a
        Tula revolver and shoot yourself through the shoulder-blade.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Sigaev suddenly felt mortified and sorry that he would be dead, and
        would miss seeing the agonies of the traitress. Revenge is only sweet
        when one can see and taste its fruits, and what sense would there be in
        it if he were lying in his coffin, knowing nothing about it?
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t I better do this?&rdquo; he pondered.
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill him, then I&rsquo;ll go to his funeral and look
        on, and after the funeral I&rsquo;ll kill myself. They&rsquo;d arrest
        me, though, before the funeral, and take away my pistol. . . . And so
        I&rsquo;ll kill him, she shall remain alive, and I . . . for the time,
        I&rsquo;ll not kill myself, but go and be arrested. I shall always have
        time to kill myself. There will be this advantage about being arrested,
        that at the preliminary investigation I shall have an opportunity of
        exposing to the authorities and to the public all the infamy of her
        conduct. If I kill myself she may, with her characteristic duplicity and
        impudence, throw all the blame on me, and society will justify her
        behaviour and will very likely laugh at me. . . . If I remain alive,
        then . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>A minute later he was thinking:</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, if I kill myself I may be blamed and suspected of petty
        feeling. . . . Besides, why should I kill myself? That&rsquo;s one
        thing. And for another, to shoot oneself is cowardly. And so I&rsquo;ll
        kill him and let her live, and I&rsquo;ll face my trial. I shall be
        tried, and she will be brought into court as a witness. . . . I can
        imagine her confusion, her disgrace when she is examined by my counsel!
        The sympathies of the court, of the Press, and of the public will
        certainly be with me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        While he deliberated the shopman displayed his wares, and felt it
        incumbent upon him to entertain his customer.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here are English ones, a new pattern, only just received,&rdquo;
        he prattled on. &ldquo;But I warn you, M&rsquo;sieu, all these systems
        pale beside the Smith and Wesson. The other day&mdash;as I dare say you
        have read&mdash;an officer bought from us a Smith and Wesson. He shot
        his wife&rsquo;s lover, and-would you believe it?&mdash;the bullet
        passed through him, pierced the bronze lamp, then the piano, and
        ricochetted back from the piano, killing the lap-dog and bruising the
        wife. A magnificent record redounding to the honour of our firm! The
        officer is now under arrest. He will no doubt be convicted and sent to
        penal servitude. In the first place, our penal code is quite out of
        date; and, secondly, M&rsquo;sieu, the sympathies of the court are
        always with the lover. Why is it? Very simple, M&rsquo;sieu. The judges
        and the jury and the prosecutor and the counsel for the defence are all
        living with other men&rsquo;s wives, and it&rsquo;ll add to their
        comfort that there will be one husband the less in Russia. Society would
        be pleased if the Government were to send all the husbands to Sahalin.
        Oh, M&rsquo;sieu, you don&rsquo;t know how it excites my indignation to
        see the corruption of morals nowadays. To love other men&rsquo;s wives
        is as much the regular thing to-day as to smoke other men&rsquo;s
        cigarettes and to read other men&rsquo;s books. Every year our trade
        gets worse and worse&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t mean that wives are more
        faithful, but that husbands resign themselves to their position and are
        afraid of the law and penal servitude.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The shopman looked round and whispered: &ldquo;And whose fault is it,
        M&rsquo;sieu? The Government&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To go to Sahalin for the sake of a pig like
        that&mdash;there&rsquo;s no sense in that either,&rdquo; Sigaev
        pondered. &ldquo;If I go to penal servitude it will only give my wife an
        opportunity of marrying again and deceiving a second husband. She would
        triumph. . . . And so I will leave her alive, I won&rsquo;t kill myself,
        him . . . I won&rsquo;t kill either. I must think of something more
        sensible and more effective. I will punish them with my contempt, and
        will take divorce proceedings that will make a scandal.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here, M&rsquo;sieu, is another make,&rdquo; said the shopman,
        taking down another dozen from the shelf. &ldquo;Let me call your
        attention to the original mechanism of the lock.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        In view of his determination a revolver was now of no use to Sigaev, but
        the shopman, meanwhile, getting more and more enthusiastic, persisted in
        displaying his wares before him. The outraged husband began to feel
        ashamed that the shopman should be taking so much trouble on his account
        for nothing, that he should be smiling, wasting time, displaying
        enthusiasm for nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, in that case,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
        look in again later on . . . or I&rsquo;ll send someone.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn&rsquo;t see the expression of the shopman&rsquo;s face, but to
        smooth over the awkwardness of the position a little he felt called upon
        to make some purchase. But what should he buy? He looked round the walls
        of the shop to pick out something inexpensive, and his eyes rested on a
        green net hanging near the door.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s . . . what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a net for catching quails.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;And what price is it?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Eight roubles, M&rsquo;sieu.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Wrap it up for me. . . .&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        The outraged husband paid his eight roubles, took the net, and, feeling
        even more outraged, walked out of the shop.
