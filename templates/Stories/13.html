      <h1>MINDS IN FERMENT (FROM THE ANNALS OF A TOWN)</h1>

      <p>
        THE earth was like an oven. The afternoon sun blazed with such energy
        that even the thermometer hanging in the excise officer&rsquo;s room
        lost its head: it ran up to 112.5 and stopped there, irresolute. The
        inhabitants streamed with perspiration like overdriven horses, and were
        too lazy to mop their faces.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two of the inhabitants were walking along the market-place in front of
        the closely shuttered houses. One was Potcheshihin, the local treasury
        clerk, and the other was Optimov, the agent, for many years a
        correspondent of the Son of the Fatherland newspaper. They walked in
        silence, speechless from the heat. Optimov felt tempted to find fault
        with the local authorities for the dust and disorder of the market-
        place, but, aware of the peace-loving disposition and moderate views of
        his companion, he said nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the middle of the market-place Potcheshihin suddenly halted and began
        gazing into the sky.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Those starlings that flew up. I wonder where they have settled.
        Clouds and clouds of them. . . . If one were to go and take a shot at
        them, and if one were to pick them up . . . and if . . . They have
        settled in the Father Prebendary&rsquo;s garden!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh no! They are not in the Father Prebendary&rsquo;s, they are in
        the Father Deacon&rsquo;s. If you did have a shot at them from here you
        wouldn&rsquo;t kill anything. Fine shot won&rsquo;t carry so far; it
        loses its force. And why should you kill them, anyway? They&rsquo;re
        birds destructive of the fruit, that&rsquo;s true; still, they&rsquo;re
        fowls of the air, works of the Lord. The starling sings, you know. . . .
        And what does it sing, pray? A song of praise. . . . &lsquo;All ye fowls
        of the air, praise ye the Lord.&rsquo; No. I do believe they have
        settled in the Father Prebendary&rsquo;s garden.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Three old pilgrim women, wearing bark shoes and carrying wallets, passed
        noiselessly by the speakers. Looking enquiringly at the gentlemen who
        were for some unknown reason staring at the Father Prebendary&rsquo;s
        house, they slackened their pace, and when they were a few yards off
        stopped, glanced at the friends once more, and then fell to gazing at
        the house themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you were right; they have settled in the Father
        Prebendary&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Optimov. &ldquo;His cherries are ripe
        now, so they have gone there to peck them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        From the garden gate emerged the Father Prebendary himself, accompanied
        by the sexton. Seeing the attention directed upon his abode and
        wondering what people were staring at, he stopped, and he, too, as well
        as the sexton, began looking upwards to find out.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The father is going to a service somewhere, I suppose,&rdquo;
        said Potcheshihin. &ldquo;The Lord be his succour!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Some workmen from Purov&rsquo;s factory, who had been bathing in the
        river, passed between the friends and the priest. Seeing the latter
        absorbed in contemplation of the heavens and the pilgrim women, too,
        standing motionless with their eyes turned upwards, they stood still and
        stared in the same direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        A small boy leading a blind beggar and a peasant, carrying a tub of
        stinking fish to throw into the market-place, did the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There must be something the matter, I should think,&rdquo; said
        Potcheshihin, &ldquo;a fire or something. But there&rsquo;s no sign of
        smoke anywhere. Hey! Kuzma!&rdquo; he shouted to the peasant,
        &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The peasant made some reply, but Potcheshihin and Optimov did not catch
        it. Sleepy-looking shopmen made their appearance at the doors of all the
        shops. Some plasterers at work on a warehouse near left their ladders
        and joined the workmen.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fireman, who was describing circles with his bare feet, on the
        watch-tower, halted, and, after looking steadily at them for a few
        minutes, came down. The watch-tower was left deserted. This seemed
        suspicious.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;There must be a fire somewhere. Don&rsquo;t shove me! You damned
        swine!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where do you see the fire? What fire? Pass on, gentlemen! I ask
        you civilly!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;It must be a fire indoors!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Asks us civilly and keeps poking with his elbows. Keep your hands
        to yourself! Though you are a head constable, you have no sort of right
        to make free with your fists!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s trodden on my corn! Ah! I&rsquo;ll crush you!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Crushed? Who&rsquo;s crushed? Lads! a man&rsquo;s been crushed!
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this crowd? What do you want?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s been crushed, please your honour!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Where? Pass on! I ask you civilly! I ask you civilly, you
        blockheads!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You may shove a peasant, but you daren&rsquo;t touch a gentleman!
        Hands off!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you ever know such people? There&rsquo;s no doing anything
        with them by fair words, the devils! Sidorov, run for Akim Danilitch!
        Look sharp! It&rsquo;ll be the worse for you, gentlemen! Akim Danilitch
        is coming, and he&rsquo;ll give it to you! You here, Parfen? A blind
        man, and at his age too! Can&rsquo;t see, but he must be like other
        people and won&rsquo;t do what he&rsquo;s told. Smirnov, put his name
        down!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir! And shall I write down the men from Purov&rsquo;s? That
        man there with the swollen cheek, he&rsquo;s from Purov&rsquo;s
        works.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t put down the men from Purov&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s
        Purov&rsquo;s birthday to-morrow.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The starlings rose in a black cloud from the Father Prebendary&rsquo;s
        garden, but Potcheshihin and Optimov did not notice them. They stood
        staring into the air, wondering what could have attracted such a crowd,
        and what it was looking at.
      </p>

      <p>
        Akim Danilitch appeared. Still munching and wiping his lips, he cut his
        way into the crowd, bellowing:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Firemen, be ready! Disperse! Mr. Optimov, disperse, or
        it&rsquo;ll be the worse for you! Instead of writing all kinds of things
        about decent people in the papers, you had better try to behave yourself
        more conformably! No good ever comes of reading the papers!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Kindly refrain from reflections upon literature!&rdquo; cried
        Optimov hotly. &ldquo;I am a literary man, and I will allow no one to
        make reflections upon literature! though, as is the duty of a citizen, I
        respect you as a father and benefactor!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Firemen, turn the hose on them!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no water, please your honour!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t answer me! Go and get some! Look sharp!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve nothing to get it in, your honour. The major has
        taken the fire- brigade horses to drive his aunt to the station.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Disperse! Stand back, damnation take you! Is that to your taste?
        Put him down, the devil!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my pencil, please your honour!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        The crowd grew larger and larger. There is no telling what proportions
        it might have reached if the new organ just arrived from Moscow had not
        fortunately begun playing in the tavern close by. Hearing their
        favourite tune, the crowd gasped and rushed off to the tavern. So nobody
        ever knew why the crowd had assembled, and Potcheshihin and Optimov had
        by now forgotten the existence of the starlings who were innocently
        responsible for the proceedings.
      </p>

      <p>
        An hour later the town was still and silent again, and only a solitary
        figure was to be seen&mdash;the fireman pacing round and round on the
        watch- tower.
      </p>

      <p>
        The same evening Akim Danilitch sat in the grocer&rsquo;s shop drinking
        limonade gaseuse and brandy, and writing:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In addition to the official report, I venture, your Excellency,
        to append a few supplementary observations of my own. Father and
        benefactor! In very truth, but for the prayers of your virtuous spouse
        in her salubrious villa near our town, there&rsquo;s no knowing what
        might not have come to pass. What I have been through to-day I can find
        no words to express. The efficiency of Krushensky and of the major of
        the fire brigade are beyond all praise! I am proud of such devoted
        servants of our country! As for me, I did all that a weak man could do,
        whose only desire is the welfare of his neighbour; and sitting now in
        the bosom of my family, with tears in my eyes I thank Him Who spared us
        bloodshed! In absence of evidence, the guilty parties remain in custody,
        but I propose to release them in a week or so. It was their ignorance
        that led them astray!&rdquo;
