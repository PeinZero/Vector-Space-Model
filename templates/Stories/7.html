      <h1>OLD AGE</h1>

      <p>
        UZELKOV, an architect with the rank of civil councillor, arrived in his
        native town, to which he had been invited to restore the church in the
        cemetery. He had been born in the town, had been at school, had grown up
        and married in it. But when he got out of the train he scarcely
        recognized it. Everything was changed. . . . Eighteen years ago when he
        had moved to Petersburg the street-boys used to catch marmots, for
        instance, on the spot where now the station was standing; now when one
        drove into the chief street, a hotel of four storeys stood facing one;
        in old days there was an ugly grey fence just there; but
        nothing&mdash;neither fences nor houses&mdash;had changed as much as the
        people. From his enquiries of the hotel waiter Uzelkov learned that more
        than half of the people he remembered were dead, reduced to poverty,
        forgotten.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And do you remember Uzelkov?&rdquo; he asked the old waiter about
        himself. &ldquo;Uzelkov the architect who divorced his wife? He used to
        have a house in Svirebeyevsky Street . . . you must remember.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember, sir.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How is it you don&rsquo;t remember? The case made a lot of noise,
        even the cabmen all knew about it. Think, now! Shapkin the attorney
        managed my divorce for me, the rascal . . . the notorious cardsharper,
        the fellow who got a thrashing at the club. . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Ivan Nikolaitch?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. . . . Well, is he alive? Is he dead?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alive, sir, thank God. He is a notary now and has an office. He
        is very well off. He has two houses in Kirpitchny Street. . . . His
        daughter was married the other day.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Uzelkov paced up and down the room, thought a bit, and in his boredom
        made up his mind to go and see Shapkin at his office. When he walked out
        of the hotel and sauntered slowly towards Kirpitchny Street it was
        midday. He found Shapkin at his office and scarcely recognized him. From
        the once well-made, adroit attorney with a mobile, insolent, and always
        drunken face Shapkin had changed into a modest, grey-headed, decrepit
        old man.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t recognize me, you have forgotten me,&rdquo; began
        Uzelkov. &ldquo;I am your old client, Uzelkov.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Uzelkov, what Uzelkov? Ah!&rdquo; Shapkin remembered, recognized,
        and was struck all of a heap. There followed a shower of exclamations,
        questions, recollections.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;This is a surprise! This is unexpected!&rdquo; cackled Shapkin.
        &ldquo;What can I offer you? Do you care for champagne? Perhaps you
        would like oysters? My dear fellow, I have had so much from you in my
        time that I can&rsquo;t offer you anything equal to the occasion. . .
        .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t put yourself out . . .&rdquo; said Uzelkov.
        &ldquo;I have no time to spare. I must go at once to the cemetery and
        examine the church; I have undertaken the restoration of it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s capital! We&rsquo;ll have a snack and a drink and
        drive together. I have capital horses. I&rsquo;ll take you there and
        introduce you to the church-warden; I will arrange it all. . . . But why
        is it, my angel, you seem to be afraid of me and hold me at arm&rsquo;s
        length? Sit a little nearer! There is no need for you to be afraid of me
        nowadays. He-he! . . . At one time, it is true, I was a cunning blade, a
        dog of a fellow . . . no one dared approach me; but now I am stiller
        than water and humbler than the grass. I have grown old, I am a family
        man, I have children. It&rsquo;s time I was dead.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The friends had lunch, had a drink, and with a pair of horses drove out
        of the town to the cemetery.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, those were times!&rdquo; Shapkin recalled as he sat in the
        sledge. &ldquo;When you remember them you simply can&rsquo;t believe in
        them. Do you remember how you divorced your wife? It&rsquo;s nearly
        twenty years ago, and I dare say you have forgotten it all; but I
        remember it as though I&rsquo;d divorced you yesterday. Good Lord, what
        a lot of worry I had over it! I was a sharp fellow, tricky and cunning,
        a desperate character. . . . Sometimes I was burning to tackle some
        ticklish business, especially if the fee were a good one, as, for
        instance, in your case. What did you pay me then? Five or six thousand!
        That was worth taking trouble for, wasn&rsquo;t it? You went off to
        Petersburg and left the whole thing in my hands to do the best I could,
        and, though Sofya Mihailovna, your wife, came only of a merchant family,
        she was proud and dignified. To bribe her to take the guilt on herself
        was difficult, awfully difficult! I would go to negotiate with her, and
        as soon as she saw me she called to her maid: &lsquo;Masha, didn&rsquo;t
        I tell you not to admit that scoundrel?&rsquo; Well, I tried one thing
        and another. . . . I wrote her letters and contrived to meet her
        accidentally&mdash;it was no use! I had to act through a third person. I
        had a lot of trouble with her for a long time, and she only gave in when
        you agreed to give her ten thousand. . . . She couldn&rsquo;t resist ten
        thousand, she couldn&rsquo;t hold out. . . . She cried, she spat in my
        face, but she consented, she took the guilt on herself!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I thought it was fifteen thousand she had from me, not
        ten,&rdquo; said Uzelkov.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes . . . fifteen&mdash;I made a mistake,&rdquo; said
        Shapkin in confusion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over and done with, though,
        it&rsquo;s no use concealing it. I gave her ten and the other five I
        collared for myself. I deceived you both. . . . It&rsquo;s all over and
        done with, it&rsquo;s no use to be ashamed. And indeed, judge for
        yourself, Boris Petrovitch, weren&rsquo;t you the very person for me to
        get money out of? . . . You were a wealthy man and had everything you
        wanted. . . . Your marriage was an idle whim, and so was your divorce.
        You were making a lot of money. . . . I remember you made a scoop of
        twenty thousand over one contract. Whom should I have fleeced if not
        you? And I must own I envied you. If you grabbed anything they took off
        their caps to you, while they would thrash me for a rouble and slap me
        in the face at the club. . . . But there, why recall it? It is high time
        to forget it.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell me, please, how did Sofya Mihailovna get on
        afterwards?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;With her ten thousand? Very badly. God knows what it
        was&mdash;she lost her head, perhaps, or maybe her pride and her
        conscience tormented her at having sold her honour, or perhaps she loved
        you; but, do you know, she took to drink. . . . As soon as she got her
        money she was off driving about with officers. It was drunkenness,
        dissipation, debauchery. . . . When she went to a restaurant with
        officers she was not content with port or anything light, she must have
        strong brandy, fiery stuff to stupefy her.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, she was eccentric. . . . I had a lot to put up with from her
        . . . sometimes she would take offence at something and begin being
        hysterical. . . . And what happened afterwards?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;One week passed and then another. . . . I was sitting at home,
        writing something. All at once the door opened and she walked in . . .
        drunk. &lsquo;Take back your cursed money,&rsquo; she said, and flung a
        roll of notes in my face. . . . So she could not keep it up. I picked up
        the notes and counted them. It was five hundred short of the ten
        thousand, so she had only managed to get through five hundred.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Where did you put the money?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all ancient history . . . there&rsquo;s no reason to
        conceal it now. . . . In my pocket, of course. Why do you look at me
        like that? Wait a bit for what will come later. . . . It&rsquo;s a
        regular novel, a pathological study. A couple of months later I was
        going home one night in a nasty drunken condition. . . . I lighted a
        candle, and lo and behold! Sofya Mihailovna was sitting on my sofa, and
        she was drunk, too, and in a frantic state&mdash;as wild as though she
        had run out of Bedlam. &lsquo;Give me back my money,&rsquo; she said,
        &lsquo;I have changed my mind; if I must go to ruin I won&rsquo;t do it
        by halves, I&rsquo;ll have my fling! Be quick, you scoundrel, give me my
        money!&rsquo; A disgraceful scene!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;And you . . . gave it her?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;I gave her, I remember, ten roubles.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! How could you?&rdquo; cried Uzelkov, frowning. &ldquo;If you
        couldn&rsquo;t or wouldn&rsquo;t have given it her, you might have
        written to me. . . . And I didn&rsquo;t know! I didn&rsquo;t
        know!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear fellow, what use would it have been for me to write,
        considering that she wrote to you herself when she was lying in the
        hospital afterwards?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but I was so taken up then with my second marriage. I was in
        such a whirl that I had no thoughts to spare for letters. . . . But you
        were an outsider, you had no antipathy for Sofya. . . why didn&rsquo;t
        you give her a helping hand? . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t judge by the standards of to-day, Boris
        Petrovitch; that&rsquo;s how we look at it now, but at the time we
        thought very differently. . . . Now maybe I&rsquo;d give her a thousand
        roubles, but then even that ten- rouble note I did not give her for
        nothing. It was a bad business! . . . We must forget it. . . . But here
        we are. . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The sledge stopped at the cemetery gates. Uzelkov and Shapkin got out of
        the sledge, went in at the gate, and walked up a long, broad avenue. The
        bare cherry-trees and acacias, the grey crosses and tombstones, were
        silvered with hoar-frost, every little grain of snow reflected the
        bright, sunny day. There was the smell there always is in cemeteries,
        the smell of incense and freshly dug earth. . . .
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Our cemetery is a pretty one,&rdquo; said Uzelkov, &ldquo;quite a
        garden!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but it is a pity thieves steal the tombstones. . . . And
        over there, beyond that iron monument on the right, Sofya Mihailovna is
        buried. Would you like to see?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The friends turned to the right and walked through the deep snow to the
        iron monument.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said Shapkin, pointing to a little slab of
        white marble. &ldquo;A lieutenant put the stone on her grave.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Uzelkov slowly took off his cap and exposed his bald head to the sun.
        Shapkin, looking at him, took off his cap too, and another bald patch
        gleamed in the sunlight. There was the stillness of the tomb all around
        as though the air, too, were dead. The friends looked at the grave,
        pondered, and said nothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She sleeps in peace,&rdquo; said Shapkin, breaking the silence.
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to her now that she took the blame on herself
        and drank brandy. You must own, Boris Petrovitch . . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Own what?&rdquo; Uzelkov asked gloomily.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why. . . . However hateful the past, it was better than
        this.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>And Shapkin pointed to his grey head.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I used not to think of the hour of death. . . . I fancied I could
        have given death points and won the game if we had had an encounter; but
        now. . . . But what&rsquo;s the good of talking!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Uzelkov was overcome with melancholy. He suddenly had a passionate
        longing to weep, as once he had longed for love, and he felt those tears
        would have tasted sweet and refreshing. A moisture came into his eyes
        and there was a lump in his throat, but . . . Shapkin was standing
        beside him and Uzelkov was ashamed to show weakness before a witness. He
        turned back abruptly and went into the church.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only two hours later, after talking to the churchwarden and looking over
        the church, he seized a moment when Shapkin was in conversation with the
        priest and hastened away to weep. . . . He stole up to the grave
        secretly, furtively, looking round him every minute. The little white
        slab looked at him pensively, mournfully, and innocently as though a
        little girl lay under it instead of a dissolute, divorced wife.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;To weep, to weep!&rdquo; thought Uzelkov.</p>

      <p>
        But the moment for tears had been missed; though the old man bAlinked
        his eyes, though he worked up his feelings, the tears did not flow nor
        the lump come in his throat. After standing for ten minutes, with a
        gesture of despair, Uzelkov went to look for Shapkin.
