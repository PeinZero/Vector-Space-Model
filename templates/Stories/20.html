      <p>A TROUBLESOME VISITOR</p>

      <p>
        IN the low-pitched, crooked little hut of Artyom, the forester, two men
        were sitting under the big dark ikon&mdash;Artyom himself, a short and
        lean peasant with a wrinkled, aged-looking face and a little beard that
        grew out of his neck, and a well-grown young man in a new crimson shirt
        and big wading boots, who had been out hunting and come in for the
        night. They were sitting on a bench at a little three-legged table on
        which a tallow candle stuck into a bottle was lazily burning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside the window the darkness of the night was full of the noisy
        uproar into which nature usually breaks out before a thunderstorm. The
        wind howled angrily and the bowed trees moaned miserably. One pane of
        the window had been pasted up with paper, and leaves torn off by the
        wind could be heard pattering against the paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you what, good Christian,&rdquo; said Artyom in a hoarse
        little tenor half-whisper, staring with unbAlinking, scared-looking eyes
        at the hunter. &ldquo;I am not afraid of wolves or bears, or wild beasts
        of any sort, but I am afraid of man. You can save yourself from beasts
        with a gun or some other weapon, but you have no means of saving
        yourself from a wicked man.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;To be sure, you can fire at a beast, but if you shoot at a robber
        you will have to answer for it: you will go to Siberia.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been forester, my lad, for thirty years, and I
        couldn&rsquo;t tell you what I have had to put up with from wicked men.
        There have been lots and lots of them here. The hut&rsquo;s on a track,
        it&rsquo;s a cart-road, and that brings them, the devils. Every sort of
        ruffian turns up, and without taking off his cap or making the sign of
        the cross, bursts straight in upon one with: &lsquo;Give us some bread,
        you old so-and-so.&rsquo; And where am I to get bread for him? What
        claim has he? Am I a millionaire to feed every drunkard that passes?
        They are half-blind with spite. . . . They have no cross on them, the
        devils . . . . They&rsquo;ll give you a clout on the ear and not think
        twice about it: &lsquo;Give us bread!&rsquo; Well, one gives it. . . .
        One is not going to fight with them, the idols! Some of them are two
        yards across the shoulders, and a great fist as big as your boot, and
        you see the sort of figure I am. One of them could smash me with his
        little finger. . . . Well, one gives him bread and he gobbles it up, and
        stretches out full length across the hut with not a word of thanks. And
        there are some that ask for money. &lsquo;Tell me, where is your
        money?&rsquo; As though I had money! How should I come by it?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A forester and no money!&rdquo; laughed the hunter. &ldquo;You
        get wages every month, and I&rsquo;ll be bound you sell timber on the
        sly.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Artyom took a timid sideway glance at his visitor and twitched his beard
        as a magpie twitches her tail.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are still young to say a thing like that to me,&rdquo; he
        said. &ldquo;You will have to answer to God for those words. Whom may
        your people be? Where do you come from?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am from Vyazovka. I am the son of Nefed the village
        elder.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You have gone out for sport with your gun. I used to like sport,
        too, when I was young. H&rsquo;m! Ah, our sins are grievous,&rdquo; said
        Artyom, with a yawn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sad thing! There are few good
        folks, but villains and murderers no end&mdash;God have mercy upon
        us.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;You seem to be frightened of me, too. . . .&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, what next! What should I be afraid of you for? I see. . . .
        I understand. . . . You came in, and not just anyhow, but you made the
        sign of the cross, you bowed, all decent and proper. . . . I understand.
        . . . One can give you bread. . . . I am a widower, I don&rsquo;t heat
        the stove, I sold the samovar. . . . I am too poor to keep meat or
        anything else, but bread you are welcome to.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment something began growling under the bench: the growl was
        followed by a hiss. Artyom started, drew up his legs, and looked
        enquiringly at the hunter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my dog worrying your cat,&rdquo; said the hunter.
        &ldquo;You devils!&rdquo; he shouted under the bench. &ldquo;Lie down.
        You&rsquo;ll be beaten. I say, your cat&rsquo;s thin, mate! She is
        nothing but skin and bone.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She is old, it is time she was dead. . . . So you say you are
        from Vyazovka?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I see you don&rsquo;t feed her. Though she&rsquo;s a cat
        she&rsquo;s a creature . . . every breathing thing. You should have pity
        on her!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are a queer lot in Vyazovka,&rdquo; Artyom went on, as though
        not listening. &ldquo;The church has been robbed twice in one year. . .
        To think that there are such wicked men! So they fear neither man nor
        God! To steal what is the Lord&rsquo;s! Hanging&rsquo;s too good for
        them! In old days the governors used to have such rogues flogged.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;However you punish, whether it is with flogging or anything else,
        it will be no good, you will not knock the wickedness out of a wicked
        man.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Save and preserve us, Queen of Heaven!&rdquo; The forester sighed
        abruptly. &ldquo;Save us from all enemies and evildoers. Last week at
        Volovy Zaimishtchy, a mower struck another on the chest with his scythe
        . . . he killed him outright! And what was it all about, God bless me!
        One mower came out of the tavern . . . drunk. The other met him, drunk
        too.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The young man, who had been listening attentively, suddenly started, and
        his face grew tense as he listened.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; he said, interrupting the forester. &ldquo;I fancy
        someone is shouting.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The hunter and the forester fell to listening with their eyes fixed on
        the window. Through the noise of the forest they could hear sounds such
        as the strained ear can always distinguish in every storm, so that it
        was difficult to make out whether people were calling for help or
        whether the wind was wailing in the chimney. But the wind tore at the
        roof, tapped at the paper on the window, and brought a distinct shout of
        &ldquo;Help!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Talk of your murderers,&rdquo; said the hunter, turning pale and
        getting up. &ldquo;Someone is being robbed!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Lord have mercy on us,&rdquo; whispered the forester, and he,
        too, turned pale and got up.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hunter looked aimlessly out of window and walked up and down the
        hut.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What a night, what a night!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You
        can&rsquo;t see your hand before your face! The very time for a robbery.
        Do you hear? There is a shout again.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The forester looked at the ikon and from the ikon turned his eyes upon
        the hunter, and sank on to the bench, collapsing like a man terrified by
        sudden bad news.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Good Christian,&rdquo; he said in a tearful voice, &ldquo;you
        might go into the passage and bolt the door. And we must put out the
        light.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;By ill-luck they may find their way here. . . . Oh, our
        sins!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We ought to be going, and you talk of bolting the door! You are a
        clever one! Are you coming?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>The hunter threw his gun over his shoulder and picked up his cap.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Get ready, take your gun. Hey, Flerka, here,&rdquo; he called to
        his dog. &ldquo;Flerka!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        A dog with long frayed ears, a mongrel between a setter and a house-dog,
        came out from under the bench. He stretched himself by his
        master&rsquo;s feet and wagged his tail.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why are you sitting there?&rdquo; cried the hunter to the
        forester. &ldquo;You mean to say you are not going?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;To help!&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; said the forester with a wave of his hand,
        shuddering all over. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bother about it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you come?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;After talking of such dreadful things I won&rsquo;t stir a step
        into the darkness. Bless them! And what should I go for?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What are you afraid of? Haven&rsquo;t you got a gun? Let us go,
        please do. It&rsquo;s scaring to go alone; it will be more cheerful, the
        two of us. Do you hear? There was a shout again. Get up!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Whatever do you think of me, lad?&rdquo; wailed the forester.
        &ldquo;Do you think I am such a fool to go straight to my
        undoing?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;So you are not coming?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        The forester did not answer. The dog, probably hearing a human cry, gave
        a plaintive whine.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you coming, I ask you?&rdquo; cried the hunter, rolling his
        eyes angrily.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You do keep on, upon my word,&rdquo; said the forester with
        annoyance. &ldquo;Go yourself.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ugh! . . . low cur,&rdquo; growled the hunter, turning towards
        the door. &ldquo;Flerka, here!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        He went out and left the door open. The wind flew into the hut. The
        flame of the candle flickered uneasily, flared up, and went out.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he bolted the door after the hunter, the forester saw the puddles in
        the track, the nearest pine-trees, and the retreating figure of his
        guest lighted up by a flash of lightning. Far away he heard the rumble
        of thunder.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy,&rdquo; whispered the forester, making haste to
        thrust the thick bolt into the great iron rings. &ldquo;What weather the
        Lord has sent us!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Going back into the room, he felt his way to the stove, lay down, and
        covered himself from head to foot. Lying under the sheepskin and
        listening intently, he could no longer hear the human cry, but the peals
        of thunder kept growing louder and more prolonged. He could hear the big
        wind-lashed raindrops pattering angrily on the panes and on the paper of
        the window.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone on a fool&rsquo;s errand,&rdquo; he thought,
        picturing the hunter soaked with rain and stumbling over the
        tree-stumps. &ldquo;I bet his teeth are chattering with terror!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Not more than ten minutes later there was a sound of footsteps, followed
        by a loud knock at the door.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; cried the forester.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s I,&rdquo; he heard the young man&rsquo;s voice.
        &ldquo;Unfasten the door.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The forester clambered down from the stove, felt for the candle, and,
        lighting it, went to the door. The hunter and his dog were drenched to
        the skin. They had come in for the heaviest of the downpour, and now the
        water ran from them as from washed clothes before they have been wrung
        out.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; asked the forester.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A peasant woman driving in a cart; she had got off the road . .
        .&rdquo; answered the young man, struggling with his breathlessness.
        &ldquo;She was caught in a thicket.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, the silly thing! She was frightened, then. . . . Well, did
        you put her on the road?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to talk to a scoundrel like you.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>The young man flung his wet cap on the bench and went on:</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I know now that you are a scoundrel and the lowest of men. And
        you a keeper, too, getting a salary! You blackguard!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The forester slunk with a guilty step to the stove, cleared his throat,
        and lay down. The young man sat on the bench, thought a little, and lay
        down on it full length. Not long afterwards he got up, put out the
        candle, and lay down again. During a particularly loud clap of thunder
        he turned over, spat on the floor, and growled out:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s afraid. . . . And what if the woman were being
        murdered? Whose business is it to defend her? And he an old man, too,
        and a Christian . . . . He&rsquo;s a pig and nothing else.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The forester cleared his throat and heaved a deep sigh. Somewhere in the
        darkness Flerka shook his wet coat vigorously, which sent drops of water
        flying about all over the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;So you wouldn&rsquo;t care if the woman were murdered?&rdquo; the
        hunter went on. &ldquo;Well&mdash;strike me, God&mdash;I had no notion
        you were that sort of man. . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        A silence followed. The thunderstorm was by now over and the thunder
        came from far away, but it was still raining.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;And suppose it hadn&rsquo;t been a woman but you shouting
        &lsquo;Help!&rsquo;?&rdquo; said the hunter, breaking the silence.
        &ldquo;How would you feel, you beast, if no one ran to your aid? You
        have upset me with your meanness, plague take you!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>After another long interval the hunter said:</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You must have money to be afraid of people! A man who is poor is
        not likely to be afraid. . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;For those words you will answer before God,&rdquo; Artyom said
        hoarsely from the stove. &ldquo;I have no money.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I dare say! Scoundrels always have money. . . . Why are you
        afraid of people, then? So you must have! I&rsquo;d like to take and rob
        you for spite, to teach you a lesson! . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Artyom slipped noiselessly from the stove, lighted a candle, and sat
        down under the holy image. He was pale and did not take his eyes off the
        hunter.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll rob you,&rdquo; said the hunter, getting up.
        &ldquo;What do you think about it? Fellows like you want a lesson. Tell
        me, where is your money hidden?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Artyom drew his legs up under him and bAlinked. &ldquo;What are you
        wriggling for? Where is your money hidden? Have you lost your tongue,
        you fool? Why don&rsquo;t you answer?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>The young man jumped up and went up to the forester.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;He is bAlinking like an owl! Well? Give me your money, or I will
        shoot you with my gun.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Why do you keep on at me?&rdquo; squealed the forester, and big
        tears rolled from his eyes. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the reason of it? God
        sees all! You will have to answer, for every word you say, to God. You
        have no right whatever to ask for my money.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The young man looked at Artyom&rsquo;s tearful face, frowned, and walked
        up and down the hut, then angrily clapped his cap on his head and picked
        up his gun.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Ugh! . . . ugh! . . . it makes me sick to look at you,&rdquo; he
        filtered through his teeth. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear the sight of you.
        I won&rsquo;t sleep in your house, anyway. Good-bye! Hey, Flerka!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The door slammed and the troublesome visitor went out with his dog. . .
        . Artyom bolted the door after him, crossed himself, and lay down.
