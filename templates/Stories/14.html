      <h1>GONE ASTRAY</h1>

      <p>
        A COUNTRY village wrapped in the darkness of night. One o&rsquo;clock
        strikes from the belfry. Two lawyers, called Kozyavkin and Laev, both in
        the best of spirits and a little unsteady on their legs, come out of the
        wood and turn towards the cottages.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, thank God, we&rsquo;ve arrived,&rdquo; says Kozyavkin,
        drawing a deep breath. &ldquo;Tramping four miles from the station in
        our condition is a feat. I am fearfully done up! And, as ill-luck would
        have it, not a fly to be seen.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Petya, my dear fellow. . . . I can&rsquo;t. . . . I feel like
        dying if I&rsquo;m not in bed in five minutes.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In bed! Don&rsquo;t you think it, my boy! First we&rsquo;ll have
        supper and a glass of red wine, and then you can go to bed. Verotchka
        and I will wake you up. . . . Ah, my dear fellow, it&rsquo;s a fine
        thing to be married! You don&rsquo;t understand it, you cold-hearted
        wretch! I shall be home in a minute, worn out and exhausted. . . . A
        loving wife will welcome me, give me some tea and something to eat, and
        repay me for my hard work and my love with such a fond and loving look
        out of her darling black eyes that I shall forget how tired I am, and
        forget the burglary and the law courts and the appeal division . . . .
        It&rsquo;s glorious!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I say, I feel as though my legs were dropping off, I
        can scarcely get along. . . . I am frightfully thirsty. . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Well, here we are at home.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        The friends go up to one of the cottages, and stand still under the
        nearest window.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a jolly cottage,&rdquo; said Kozyavkin. &ldquo;You
        will see to-morrow what views we have! There&rsquo;s no light in the
        windows. Verotchka must have gone to bed, then; she must have got tired
        of sitting up. She&rsquo;s in bed, and must be worrying at my not having
        turned up.&rdquo; (He pushes the window with his stick, and it opens.)
        &ldquo;Plucky girl! She goes to bed without bolting the window.&rdquo;
        (He takes off his cape and flings it with his portfolio in at the
        window.) &ldquo;I am hot! Let us strike up a serenade and make her
        laugh!&rdquo; (He sings.) &ldquo;The moon floats in the midnight sky. .
        . . Faintly stir the tender breezes . . . . Faintly rustle in the
        treetops. . . . Sing, sing, Alyosha! Verotchka, shall we sing you
        Schubert&rsquo;s Serenade?&rdquo; (He sings.)
      </p>

      <p>
        His performance is cut short by a sudden fit of coughing. &ldquo;Tphoo!
        Verotchka, tell Aksinya to unlock the gate for us!&rdquo; (A pause.)
        &ldquo;Verotchka! don&rsquo;t be lazy, get up, darling!&rdquo; (He
        stands on a stone and looks in at the window.) &ldquo;Verotchka, my
        dumpling; Verotchka, my poppet . . . my little angel, my wife beyond
        compare, get up and tell Aksinya to unlock the gate for us! You are not
        asleep, you know. Little wife, we are really so done up and exhausted
        that we&rsquo;re not in the mood for jokes. We&rsquo;ve trudged all the
        way from the station! Don&rsquo;t you hear? Ah, hang it all!&rdquo; (He
        makes an effort to climb up to the window and falls down.) &ldquo;You
        know this isn&rsquo;t a nice trick to play on a visitor! I see you are
        just as great a schoolgirl as ever, Vera, you are always up to
        mischief!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Perhaps Vera Stepanovna is asleep,&rdquo; says Laev.</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t asleep! I bet she wants me to make an outcry and
        wake up the whole neighbourhood. I&rsquo;m beginning to get cross, Vera!
        Ach, damn it all! Give me a leg up, Alyosha; I&rsquo;ll get in. You are
        a naughty girl, nothing but a regular schoolgirl. . . Give me a
        hoist.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Puffing and panting, Laev gives him a leg up, and Kozyavkin climbs in at
        the window and vanishes into the darkness within.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Vera!&rdquo; Laev hears a minute later, &ldquo;where are you? . .
        . D&mdash;damnation! Tphoo! I&rsquo;ve put my hand into something!
        Tphoo!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a rustling sound, a flapping of wings, and the desperate
        cackling of a fowl.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A nice state of things,&rdquo; Laev hears. &ldquo;Vera, where on
        earth did these chickens come from? Why, the devil, there&rsquo;s no end
        of them! There&rsquo;s a basket with a turkey in it. . . . It pecks, the
        nasty creature.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Two hens fly out of the window, and cackling at the top of their voices,
        flutter down the village street.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Alyosha, we&rsquo;ve made a mistake!&rdquo; says Kozyavkin in a
        lachrymose voice. &ldquo;There are a lot of hens here. . . . I must have
        mistaken the house. Confound you, you are all over the place, you cursed
        brutes!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, make haste and come down. Do you hear? I am dying of
        thirst!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In a minute. . . . I am looking for my cape and portfolio.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Light a match.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The matches are in the cape. . . . I was a crazy idiot to get
        into this place. The cottages are exactly alike; the devil himself
        couldn&rsquo;t tell them apart in the dark. Aie, the turkey&rsquo;s
        pecked my cheek, nasty creature!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Make haste and get out or they&rsquo;ll think we are stealing the
        chickens.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In a minute. . . . I can&rsquo;t find my cape anywhere. . . .
        There are lots of old rags here, and I can&rsquo;t tell where the cape
        is. Throw me a match.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t any.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;We are in a hole, I must say! What am I to do? I can&rsquo;t go
        without my cape and my portfolio. I must find them.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand a man&rsquo;s not knowing his own
        cottage,&rdquo; says Laev indignantly. &ldquo;Drunken beast. . . . If
        I&rsquo;d known I was in for this sort of thing I would never have come
        with you. I should have been at home and fast asleep by now, and a nice
        fix I&rsquo;m in here. . . . I&rsquo;m fearfully done up and thirsty,
        and my head is going round.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;In a minute, in a minute. . . . You won&rsquo;t expire.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        A big cock flies crowing over Laev&rsquo;s head. Laev heaves a deep
        sigh, and with a hopeless gesture sits down on a stone. He is beset with
        a burning thirst, his eyes are closing, his head drops forward. . . .
        Five minutes pass, ten, twenty, and Kozyavkin is still busy among the
        hens.
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;Petya, will you be long?&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;A minute. I found the portfolio, but I have lost it again.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Laev lays his head on his fists, and closes his eyes. The cackling of
        the fowls grows louder and louder. The inhabitants of the empty cottage
        fly out of the window and flutter round in circles, he fancies, like
        owls over his head. His ears ring with their cackle, he is overwhelmed
        with terror.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;The beast!&rdquo; he thinks. &ldquo;He invited me to stay,
        promising me wine and junket, and then he makes me walk from the station
        and listen to these hens. . . .&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        In the midst of his indignation his chin sinks into his collar, he lays
        his head on his portfolio, and gradually subsides. Weariness gets the
        upper hand and he begins to doze.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found the portfolio!&rdquo; he hears Kozyavkin cry
        triumphantly. &ldquo;I shall find the cape in a minute and then off we
        go!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Then through his sleep he hears the barking of dogs. First one dog
        barks, then a second, and a third. . . . And the barking of the dogs
        blends with the cackling of the fowls into a sort of savage music.
        Someone comes up to Laev and asks him something. Then he hears someone
        climb over his head into the window, then a knocking and a shouting. . .
        . A woman in a red apron stands beside him with a lantern in her hand
        and asks him something.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right to say so,&rdquo; he hears
        Kozyavkin&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;I am a lawyer, a bachelor of
        laws&mdash;Kozyavkin&mdash;here&rsquo;s my visiting card.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;What do I want with your card?&rdquo; says someone in a husky
        bass. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve disturbed all my fowls, you&rsquo;ve smashed
        the eggs! Look what you&rsquo;ve done. The turkey poults were to have
        come out to-day or to-morrow, and you&rsquo;ve smashed them.
        What&rsquo;s the use of your giving me your card, sir?&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;How dare you interfere with me! No! I won&rsquo;t have it!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am thirsty,&rdquo; thinks Laev, trying to open his eyes, and he
        feels somebody climb down from the window over his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;My name is Kozyavkin! I have a cottage here. Everyone knows
        me.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know anyone called Kozyavkin.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>&ldquo;What are you saying? Call the elder. He knows me.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited, the constable will be here directly. . .
        . We know all the summer visitors here, but I&rsquo;ve never seen you in
        my life.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a cottage in Rottendale for five years.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Whew! Do you take this for the Dale? This is Sicklystead, but
        Rottendale is farther to the right, beyond the match factory. It&rsquo;s
        three miles from here.&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;Bless my soul! Then I&rsquo;ve taken the wrong turning!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        The cries of men and fowls mingle with the barking of dogs, and the
        voice of Kozyavkin rises above the chaos of confused sounds:
      </p>

      <p>
        &ldquo;You shut up! I&rsquo;ll pay. I&rsquo;ll show you whom you have to
        deal with!&rdquo;
      </p>

      <p>
        Little by little the voices die down. Laev feels himself being shaken by
        the shoulder. . . .
